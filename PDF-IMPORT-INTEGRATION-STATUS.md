   - Enhanced field detection with wedding patterns
   - Context-aware confidence scoring
   - Field relationship analysis
   - Table extraction capability
   - Signature detection

2. **Google Vision Integration** (`/src/lib/ocr/google-vision.ts`)
   - 90+ wedding-specific regex patterns
   - Multi-format date detection
   - Venue recognition patterns
   - Enhanced confidence calculation
   - Field proximity analysis

3. **PDF Validator** (`/src/lib/ocr/pdf-validator.ts`)
   - Corruption detection
   - Auto-repair functionality
   - Encryption detection
   - Document type classification
   - Security scanning

4. **Performance Optimizer** (`/src/lib/ocr/performance-optimizer.ts`)
   - Parallel processing (4 workers)
   - Smart caching (15-min TTL)
   - Chunk-based processing
   - Memory optimization

5. **UI Components** (`/src/components/pdf/PDFProcessingProgress.tsx`)
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Step-by-step visualization
   - Accuracy display
   - Error state handling

## 🔗 Integration Points

### With Core Fields System ✅
```javascript
// Automatic mapping to wedding fields
detectCoreFieldFromLabel(label) → {
  field_key: 'bride_name',
  confidence: 0.92
}
```

### With Forms API ✅
```javascript
// Direct form creation from PDF
POST /api/forms/create-from-pdf
→ Instant form with pre-populated fields
```

### With Security Layer ✅
```javascript
// Tier enforcement (Pro/Scale only)
await enforceTierLimits(request, 'pdfImport')
```

---

## 🛡️ Error Handling & Recovery

### Implemented Safeguards
1. **Corrupted PDF** → Auto-repair attempt
2. **Encrypted PDF** → Clear user message
3. **Image-only PDF** → Enhanced OCR mode
4. **Large files** → Chunked processing
5. **Network failures** → Retry with backoff

### Validation Pipeline
```
Upload → Validate → Scan → Process → Map → Create
  ↓        ↓         ↓        ↓       ↓      ↓
Error → Reject   Repair   Retry   Manual  Rollback
```
