## ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Production)

### 🚨 **SECURITY VULNERABILITIES**

#### 1. **Missing Webhook Signature Validation** (CRITICAL)
**File**: `/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`
```typescript
// CURRENT (VULNERABLE)
const event = JSON.parse(body) // No signature validation!

// REQUIRED FIX
const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
  body, 
  signature, 
  process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
)
```
**Risk**: Attackers can forge webhook events
**PCI Impact**: Fails PCI DSS compliance

#### 2. **No Organization Ownership Verification** (HIGH)
**File**: `/api/stripe/create-checkout-session/route.ts`
- Users can potentially purchase for other organizations
- Missing role-based access control

#### 3. **Rate Limiting Not Applied** (MEDIUM)
- Payment endpoints vulnerable to DoS attacks
- No protection against abuse

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Priority 1: Security Fixes (24 hours)
```typescript
// 1. Fix webhook signature validation
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.text()
  const signature = request.headers.get('stripe-signature')
  
  if (!signature) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Missing signature' }, { status: 400 })
  }
  
  try {
    const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
      body,
      signature,
      process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!
    )
    // Process verified event
  } catch (err) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid signature' }, { status: 400 })
  }
}

// 2. Add ownership verification
if (org.ownerId !== user.id && user.role !== 'ADMIN') {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 403 })
}

// 3. Apply rate limiting
return withRateLimit(request, { limit: 5, type: 'payment' }, async () => {
  // Process payment
})
```

### Priority 2: Testing Requirements (Before Go-Live)
1. ✅ Manual testing of all 5 tiers
2. ✅ Test mode transactions in Stripe
3. ⏳ Production webhook testing
4. ⏳ Load testing with 100+ concurrent users
5. ⏳ Security penetration testing
