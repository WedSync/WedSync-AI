# WedSync Project Overview

## Project Purpose
WedSync is a comprehensive wedding management platform designed to solve the problem of wedding vendors wasting 10+ hours per wedding on administrative tasks. It consists of two main components:

- **WedSync (B2B)**: For wedding suppliers (photographers, venues, florists, etc.)
- **WedMe (B2C)**: For couples (FREE - viral growth driver)

**Vision**: 400,000 users, Â£192M ARR potential

## Key Business Model
The platform uses a viral growth mechanism where:
1. Vendor imports 200+ existing clients
2. Invites couples to WedMe (free)
3. Couples see ALL their vendors
4. Couples invite missing vendors
5. Those vendors sign up for WedSync
6. Repeat exponentially

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Wedding suppliers (photographers, venues, florists, planners)
- **Secondary**: Couples getting married
- **Market**: Wedding industry professionals who need to streamline admin work
