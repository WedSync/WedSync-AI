## 🎯 Personalizing Your Emails: The Magic of Merge Tags

### Understanding Merge Tags

Think of merge tags as blanks in a form letter that get filled in automatically. Instead of writing "Dear Bride and Groom," you write "Dear {couple_names}" and it becomes "Dear Sarah & Michael."

### The Personalization Panel

#### **Auto-Population** ✨
When you have client information in WedSync, merge tags fill themselves:
- Client profile data flows in automatically
- Previous communication history is referenced
- Wedding details are pulled from your CRM

#### **Manual Entry** ✍️
For new inquiries, you can quickly fill in:
- **Couple Names**: Sarah & Michael
- **Wedding Date**: June 15, 2025
- **Venue Name**: The Grand Ballroom
- **Guest Count**: 120
- **Special Requests**: Vegetarian options, outdoor ceremony

#### **Smart Validation** ✅
The system helps you avoid mistakes:
- Required fields are clearly marked
- Date formats are validated (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Spelling suggestions for common venue names
- Warnings for unusual guest counts or dates

### Live Preview Feature

#### **Real-Time Updates** ⚡
As you type in merge tag values:
- Preview updates instantly
- See exactly how the email will look
- Catch any formatting issues immediately
- Ensure personalization flows naturally

#### **Mobile Preview** 📱
Since many couples read emails on phones:
- Preview shows mobile formatting
- Text wrapping is optimized
- Subject lines are tested for mobile length
- Links and buttons are touch-friendly

#### **Content Warnings** ⚠️
The AI watches for potential issues:
- **Urgent Language**: "URGENT" or "IMMEDIATE" can seem pushy
- **Too Salesy**: Excessive promotional language
- **Unprofessional**: Casual language in formal templates
- **Missing Information**: Important details not included

---

## 🔬 A/B Testing Your Email Templates

### Why Test Different Approaches?

Just like a photographer might try different poses to get the perfect shot, testing different email approaches helps you find what works best for your couples.

### Setting Up A/B Tests

#### **Select Variants** 📊
1. Choose 2-3 templates you want to compare
2. Give your test a descriptive name: "Photography Inquiry - Warm vs Professional"
3. Set your test parameters:
   - **Sample Size**: How many couples to include (minimum 50 for meaningful results)
   - **Test Duration**: 1-4 weeks typically
   - **Success Metric**: Response rate, booking rate, or phone calls

#### **What to Test** 🎯
- **Subject Lines**: Short vs detailed
- **Tone**: Professional vs friendly
- **Structure**: Brief vs comprehensive
- **Call-to-Action**: "Call me" vs "Schedule a call" vs "Reply to this email"

#### **Reading Results** 📈
After your test runs:
- **Open Rate**: How many couples opened the email
- **Response Rate**: How many replied or took action
- **Booking Rate**: How many actually booked your services
- **Statistical Confidence**: Whether the results are meaningful (95% confidence recommended)

### Best Practices for Wedding Vendor A/B Testing

#### **Test One Thing at a Time** 🎯
- Don't change both subject line AND content
- Focus on one variable: tone, length, or call-to-action
- This helps you understand what actually made the difference

#### **Give Tests Time** ⏱️
- Wedding couples often take days or weeks to decide
- Run tests for at least 2 weeks
- Include both weekday and weekend inquiries

#### **Consider Seasonality** 🌸
- Summer inquiry responses differ from winter
- Holiday periods affect response times
- Engagement season (November-February) has different dynamics
