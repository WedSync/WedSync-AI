### Post-Incident Process

After resolving any incident:

1. **Document in incident log** - Record what happened, when, and how it was resolved
2. **Update monitoring** - Add new alerts if the issue wasn't caught early enough
3. **Create prevention tasks** - Add items to the backlog to prevent recurrence
4. **Review and improve** - Update runbooks based on what was learned
5. **Communicate** - Send summary to stakeholders if it was a significant incident

### Runbook Maintenance

These runbooks should be reviewed and updated:
- **Monthly**: Review all runbooks for accuracy
- **After each incident**: Update based on lessons learned
- **Quarterly**: Full review of all procedures and contacts
- **When systems change**: Update commands and procedures
