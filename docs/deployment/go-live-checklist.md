npm run deploy:production

# Run post-deployment validation
npm run validate:production
```

**Production Deployment Steps:**
1. [ ] **Pre-deployment backup** - Full database and file backup
2. [ ] **Maintenance mode** - Enable maintenance page
3. [ ] **Code deployment** - Deploy new version
4. [ ] **Database migration** - Run any pending migrations
5. [ ] **Cache warming** - Warm up application caches
6. [ ] **Health checks** - Verify all systems operational
7. [ ] **Disable maintenance** - Switch to live application
8. [ ] **Monitor metrics** - Watch for 15 minutes minimum

### 3. Post-Deployment Validation

## 🔧 Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (Critical Issues)

```bash
# Emergency rollback to previous version
