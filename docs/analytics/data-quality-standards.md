# WedSync Data Quality Standards & Validation Procedures

## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive data quality standards for the WedSync analytics platform, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability of cohort analysis and business intelligence systems.

## Data Quality Framework

### Quality Dimensions

#### 1. Completeness (Target: >95%)
Percentage of required fields populated with valid data.

**Critical Fields:**
- User ID: 100% required
- Registration Date: 100% required  
- Supplier Type: 100% required
- Revenue Data: >90% required
- Engagement Events: >85% required

**Validation Rules:**
```typescript
const completenessRules = {
  userId: { required: true, nullable: false },
  registrationDate: { required: true, format: 'ISO8601' },
  supplierType: { required: true, enum: VALID_SUPPLIER_TYPES },
  revenue: { required: false, minCoverage: 0.90 },
  lastActivity: { required: false, minCoverage: 0.85 }
};
```

#### 2. Accuracy (Target: >99%)
Correctness of data values against known benchmarks and business rules.

**Validation Checks:**
- Revenue values within industry ranges
- Retention rates between 0 and 1
- Date consistency (end > start dates)
- Geographic data validation against standard codes
- Supplier type alignment with service categories

**Industry Benchmarks:**
```typescript
const industryBenchmarks = {
  photographer: { minLTV: 1500, maxLTV: 8000, avgRetention: 0.32 },
  venue: { minLTV: 2500, maxLTV: 15000, avgRetention: 0.37 },
  caterer: { minLTV: 2000, maxLTV: 12000, avgRetention: 0.35 },
  florist: { minLTV: 1000, maxLTV: 5000, avgRetention: 0.28 }
};
```

#### 3. Consistency (Target: >98%)
Internal logical consistency across related data fields.

**Cross-Field Validation:**
- LTV reasonably related to revenue per user (0.5x to 5x range)
- Churn rate consistent with retention rates
- Seasonal adjustments align with historical patterns
- Geographic data matches service coverage areas

#### 4. Timeliness (Target: >95%)
Data freshness and update frequency meeting business requirements.

**Freshness Requirements:**
- User activity data: Updated within 1 hour
- Revenue data: Updated within 24 hours
- Cohort calculations: Refreshed every 6 hours
- Dashboard metrics: Real-time to 15-minute delay

#### 5. Validity (Target: >99%)
Data format and range compliance with defined standards.

**Format Standards:**
```typescript
const formatStandards = {
  userId: /^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/,
  email: /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/,
  phone: /^\+?[\d\s\-\(\)\.]+$/,
  currency: /^\d+\.\d{2}$/,
  percentage: /^0\.\d+$|^1\.0+$/
};
```

#### 6. Uniqueness (Target: >99.5%)
Absence of duplicate records where uniqueness is required.

**Uniqueness Constraints:**
- User IDs must be unique across platform
- Email addresses unique per supplier type
- Cohort IDs unique per analysis period
- Event IDs unique per tracking session

## Validation Procedures

### Automated Data Quality Checks

#### Real-Time Validation
Performed on data ingestion:

```typescript
interface RealTimeValidation {
  schemaValidation: boolean;    // Data structure compliance
  formatValidation: boolean;    // Format pattern matching
  rangeValidation: boolean;     // Value range checking
  businessRuleValidation: boolean; // Industry logic validation
}
```

**Implementation:**
```sql
-- Example: Real-time revenue validation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION validate_revenue_data()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Range validation
  IF NEW.revenue < 0 OR NEW.revenue > 100000 THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Revenue value out of acceptable range: %', NEW.revenue;
  END IF;
  
  -- Consistency validation with user count
  IF NEW.revenue / NEW.user_count < 500 OR NEW.revenue / NEW.user_count > 10000 THEN
    RAISE WARNING 'Revenue per user outside typical range: %', NEW.revenue / NEW.user_count;
  END IF;
  
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Batch Quality Assessment
Daily comprehensive data quality evaluation:

```typescript
interface BatchValidationReport {
  completenessScore: number;
  accuracyScore: number;
  consistencyScore: number;
  timelinessScore: number;
  validityScore: number;
  uniquenessScore: number;
  overallScore: number;
  violationCount: number;
  criticalIssues: ValidationIssue[];
}
```

### Statistical Validation

#### Distribution Analysis
Monitor data distributions for anomalies:

```python
def validate_distributions(data):
    """Validate data distributions against historical patterns."""
    results = {}
    
    # LTV distribution validation
    ltv_current = data['ltv'].describe()
    ltv_historical = get_historical_distribution('ltv')
    
    # Check for significant shifts (>2 standard deviations)
    if abs(ltv_current['mean'] - ltv_historical['mean']) > 2 * ltv_historical['std']:
        results['ltv_mean_shift'] = True
        
    # Retention rate distribution
    retention_outliers = detect_outliers(data['retention_rates'])
    results['retention_outliers'] = len(retention_outliers)
    
    return results
```

#### Correlation Analysis
Validate expected relationships between variables:

```sql
-- Monitor key correlation metrics
WITH correlation_metrics AS (
  SELECT 
    corr(ltv, revenue / user_count) as ltv_revenue_correlation,
    corr(retention_month_1, retention_month_3) as retention_consistency,
    corr(seasonal_multiplier, ltv) as seasonal_ltv_correlation
  FROM cohort_analysis
  WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
)
SELECT 
  *,
  CASE 
    WHEN ltv_revenue_correlation < 0.5 THEN 'WARNING: Low LTV-Revenue correlation'
    WHEN retention_consistency < 0.8 THEN 'WARNING: Inconsistent retention pattern'  
    ELSE 'OK'
  END as validation_status
FROM correlation_metrics;
```

### Data Quality Monitoring

#### Continuous Monitoring Dashboard

**Key Metrics Tracked:**
1. **Data Freshness**: Time since last update by data source
2. **Completeness Trends**: Daily completeness scores by field
3. **Accuracy Violations**: Count and severity of validation failures
4. **Consistency Checks**: Cross-field validation results
5. **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical outliers and unusual patterns

#### Alert Thresholds

**Critical Alerts (Immediate Action Required):**
- Overall data quality score < 85%
- >5% of records failing validation
- Data freshness > 4 hours for critical feeds
- >10 critical business rule violations per hour

**Warning Alerts (Monitor Closely):**

  month,
  avg_ltv,
  CASE 
    WHEN month IN (3,4,5) AND avg_ltv < 2000 THEN 'WARNING: Spring LTV below threshold'
    WHEN month IN (12,1,2) AND avg_ltv > 2800 THEN 'WARNING: Winter LTV above expected'
    ELSE 'OK'
  END as seasonal_validation
FROM seasonal_validation;
```

#### Supplier Type Validation
```sql
-- Validate supplier-specific metrics
SELECT 
  supplier_type,
  COUNT(*) as cohort_count,
  AVG(ltv) as avg_ltv,
  CASE 
    WHEN supplier_type = 'venue' AND AVG(ltv) < 3500 THEN 'LOW_LTV_VENUE'
    WHEN supplier_type = 'photographer' AND AVG(ltv) > 4000 THEN 'HIGH_LTV_PHOTOGRAPHER' 
    WHEN supplier_type = 'florist' AND AVG(ltv) > 3000 THEN 'HIGH_LTV_FLORIST'
    ELSE 'WITHIN_RANGE'
  END as validation_flag
FROM cohort_analysis
GROUP BY supplier_type
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10; -- Minimum sample size
```

## Quality Assurance Testing

### Automated Testing Framework

#### Unit Tests for Data Quality Rules
```typescript
describe('Data Quality Validation', () => {
  describe('Revenue Validation', () => {
    it('should reject negative revenue values', () => {
      const invalidData = { revenue: -1000, userCount: 50 };
      expect(validateRevenue(invalidData)).toBe(false);
    });
    
    it('should accept valid revenue ranges', () => {
      const validData = { revenue: 125000, userCount: 50 };
      expect(validateRevenue(validData)).toBe(true);
    });
  });
  
  describe('Retention Rate Validation', () => {
    it('should ensure monotonic decrease in retention rates', () => {
      const validRates = [0.95, 0.68, 0.45, 0.32];
      const invalidRates = [0.95, 0.88, 0.75, 0.45]; // Not monotonic
      
      expect(validateRetentionMonotonicity(validRates)).toBe(true);
      expect(validateRetentionMonotonicity(invalidRates)).toBe(false);
    });
  });
});
```

#### Integration Tests for End-to-End Quality
```typescript
describe('End-to-End Data Quality', () => {
  it('should maintain quality through full pipeline', async () => {
    const testCohort = await createTestCohort(100, '2024-01-01');
    const processedData = await runFullPipeline(testCohort);
    const qualityReport = await assessDataQuality(processedData);
    
    expect(qualityReport.overallScore).toBeGreaterThan(0.95);
