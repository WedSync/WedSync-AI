# WedSync Broadcast Events System - Testing Strategy

## Overview
Comprehensive testing strategy for WedSync's Broadcast Events System, designed specifically for the wedding industry's unique requirements where reliability is paramount for once-in-a-lifetime events.

## Critical Wedding Industry Context
- **Zero Tolerance for Failures**: Wedding events are irreplaceable
- **Peak Season Considerations**: June-September traffic spikes (3x normal load)
- **Time-Sensitive Communications**: Emergency broadcasts must reach all stakeholders instantly
- **Privacy Requirements**: Cross-wedding data isolation is mandatory
- **Multi-Stakeholder Complexity**: Venues, photographers, planners, couples, families

## Testing Framework Architecture

### 1. E2E Testing (Playwright)
**Location**: `/src/__tests__/e2e/broadcast/`

**Critical Scenarios Tested**:
- **Venue Emergency Protocol**: System-wide alerts for venue issues
- **Coordinator Handoffs**: Seamless communication transfer between planners
- **Wedding Privacy Boundaries**: Ensure broadcasts don't leak between weddings
- **Priority Message Handling**: Critical alerts bypass standard queues
- **Multi-Device Synchronization**: Messages appear consistently across all platforms

**Key Test Files**:
- `broadcast-system.spec.ts` - Main E2E test suite (24 comprehensive scenarios)
- `privacy-boundaries.spec.ts` - Cross-wedding isolation testing
- `emergency-protocols.spec.ts` - Critical alert system validation

### 2. Performance Testing
**Location**: `/src/__tests__/performance/broadcast/`

**Performance Requirements**:
- **Concurrent Connections**: 10,000+ simultaneous users
- **Processing Latency**: Sub-100ms broadcast delivery
- **Wedding Season Load**: 3x baseline traffic during peak months
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 95%+ for optimal performance
- **Queue Processing**: 1,000+ messages/second throughput

**Load Testing Scenarios**:
- **June Wedding Season Simulation**: Peak traffic with realistic user patterns
- **Venue Emergency Cascade**: Stress test during high-priority alerts
- **Multi-Wedding Coordination**: Simultaneous events with overlapping stakeholders

### 3. Integration Testing
**Location**: `/src/__tests__/integration/external/`

**External Service Integration**:
- **Email Service (Resend)**: Template rendering, delivery confirmation, bounce handling
- **SMS Service (Twilio)**: Message delivery, internationalization, opt-out management
- **Calendar Integration (Google)**: Event synchronization, timezone handling
- **Workspace Integration (Slack)**: Team notifications, channel management

**Mock Service Architecture**:
- Realistic failure simulation (2% email bounce rate, 1% SMS failures)
- Rate limiting compliance testing
- Authentication and token refresh validation

### 4. Unit Testing
**Location**: `/src/__tests__/unit/broadcast/`

**Core Components Tested**:
- **Queue Manager**: Priority handling, batch processing, dead letter queues
- **Cache Manager**: LRU eviction, memory optimization, hit/miss ratios
- **Auto-Scaler**: Predictive scaling for wedding season patterns
- **Message Formatter**: Template processing, personalization, multimedia handling

## Testing Data Factory System

### Wedding Data Factory
**Location**: `/src/__tests__/factories/wedding-data-factory.ts`

**Generated Test Scenarios**:
- **Complete Wedding Teams**: Realistic stakeholder hierarchies
- **Emergency Situations**: Venue issues, weather alerts, vendor no-shows
- **Seasonal Patterns**: June peak season with authentic booking distributions
- **Multi-Wedding Days**: Saturday coordination challenges

### Broadcast Test Helper
**Location**: `/src/__tests__/helpers/broadcast-test-helper.ts`

**Utility Functions**:
- WebSocket connection simulation
- Delivery status tracking
- Cross-device synchronization testing
- Performance metric collection
