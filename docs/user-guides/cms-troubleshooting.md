## Content Creation Problems

### Text Formatting Issues

**Problem:** Formatting inconsistent or weird
**Solutions:**

- Don't copy/paste from Word or other programs with formatting
- Use Ctrl+Shift+V for plain text paste

**Problem:** Can't change font size or style
**Reality Check:** The CMS uses consistent typography for professional appearance. Use headings (H1, H2, H3) for size variation instead of arbitrary font sizing.

**Problem:** Bullets/numbering not working
**Solutions:**

- Press Enter to create new list items
- Use Tab to indent, Shift+Tab to outdent
- Press Enter twice to exit list mode

### Image Upload Problems

**Problem:** "Upload failed" error
**Troubleshooting Checklist:**
- [ ] File size under 10MB?
