## Best Practices

### 🎯 Maximizing AI Effectiveness

#### **1. Start Simple, Scale Gradually**
- Begin with basic photo tagging
- Add menu planning once comfortable
- Introduce venue coordination for complex events
- Upgrade to Client AI when consistently hitting limits

#### **2. Optimize Your Workflow**
**For Photographers:**
```
Wedding Day → Upload RAW files → AI quality assessment →

```

**For Venues:**
```
Booking confirmed → Guest count update → AI layout planning → 
Vendor coordination → Weather monitoring → Event execution
```

**For Caterers:**
```

```

#### **3. Batch Processing Strategy**
- Process photos in batches of 25-50 for optimal speed
- Group similar requests (all tagging, then all albums)
- Schedule large processing jobs during off-peak hours
- Use weekend processing for non-urgent tasks

### 💡 Cost Optimization Tips

#### **Smart Platform AI Usage:**
1. **Prioritize high-value tasks:** Use AI for client-facing deliverables first
2. **Combine requests:** Process album creation with tagging in one batch
3. **Seasonal planning:** Build quota reserves before busy wedding season
4. **Feature rotation:** Focus on different AI features throughout the month

#### **Client AI Optimization:**
1. **Model selection:** Use GPT-3.5 for simple tasks, GPT-4 for complex ones

3. **Batch similar requests:** Group same-type processing for efficiency
4. **Monitor spending:** Weekly check-ins prevent surprise bills

### 📊 Quality Improvement

#### **GDPR Compliance:**
- Obtain written consent for AI processing of photos
- Provide clients with option to opt-out of AI features
- Maintain records of AI processing activities
- Implement data retention policies (delete processed data after event)
