# Customer Journey Builder UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for Customer Journey Builder's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

**Primary Persona - Sarah, Wedding Photographer**
- Non-technical creative professional managing 30-40 weddings annually
- Values efficiency but prioritizes maintaining personal client relationships
- Needs visual, intuitive tools that don't require coding knowledge
- Seeks to automate repetitive tasks while preserving flexibility for different packages

**Secondary Persona - Michael, DJ/Entertainment**  
- High-volume event manager (60+ events annually)
- Focuses on operational efficiency and timeline coordination
- Needs quick setup and reliable automation
- Values integration with other vendor tools

**Tertiary Persona - Wedding Planner/Coordinator**
- Manages multiple vendor relationships simultaneously
- Requires overview visibility and control
- Needs collaborative features and client communication tracking

#### Usability Goals

- **Intuitive Visual Building**: Users can create their first journey within 10 minutes without tutorials
- **Error Prevention**: Visual validation prevents broken journeys with clear indicators of issues
- **Efficient Power Use**: Expert users can build complex journeys in under 5 minutes using keyboard shortcuts
- **Immediate Feedback**: Every action provides instant visual confirmation with smooth animations
- **Graceful Learning Curve**: Progressive disclosure from simple linear flows to complex branching logic

#### Design Principles

1. **Visual Clarity First** - The canvas should tell the story of the customer journey at a glance, using clear visual hierarchy and meaningful icons
2. **Non-Technical by Design** - Hide complexity behind intuitive visual metaphors that wedding professionals naturally understand
3. **Confidence Through Preview** - Users can always see and test exactly what their clients will experience before going live
4. **Smart Defaults, Full Control** - Provide wedding-optimized templates and suggestions while allowing complete customization
5. **Mobile-Conscious Creation** - Design for monitoring and quick edits on mobile, even if primary creation happens on desktop

#### Performance Perception Principles

**1. Instant Visual Feedback (0-100ms)**
- Every drag, click, or keyboard action shows immediate visual response
- Node highlights on hover, connection previews while dragging
- Cursor changes to indicate available actions
- Micro-animations confirm state changes

**2. Optimistic UI Updates (100-300ms)**
- Show success states immediately, reconcile with server later
- Add nodes to canvas instantly while saving in background
- Display email preview immediately while template loads
- Update journey stats optimistically before server confirmation

**3. Progressive Loading with Skeleton States**
- Load canvas structure first, then populate node details
- Show journey outline immediately, lazy-load analytics
- Display placeholder content during data fetches
- Prioritize visible viewport content over off-screen elements

**4. Perceived Speed Through Animation**
- Smooth 60fps canvas panning and zooming
- Spring animations for node connections (300ms easing)
- Staggered animations when loading multiple elements
- Momentum scrolling for natural canvas navigation

**5. Background Processing Transparency**
- Progress indicators for journey publishing (with time estimates)
- Real-time status updates during test runs
- Queue visualization for bulk operations
- "Working" states that show specific actions ("Validating connections...")

**6. Smart Preloading & Caching**
- Preload common node templates on canvas open
- Cache recently used email templates and forms
- Prefetch next likely actions based on user patterns
- Store journey drafts locally for instant recovery

**7. Responsive Performance Degradation**
- Simplify animations on slower devices
- Reduce visual effects when journey exceeds 50 nodes
- Offer "performance mode" for complex journeys
- Auto-switch to simplified view on mobile

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

1. **Purposeful** - Every animation has a clear function
2. **Fast** - Most animations complete in 200-300ms
3. **Smooth** - Use easing functions for natural movement
4. **Subtle** - Enhance, don't distract from the task
5. **Consistent** - Same actions produce same animations

### Key Animations

- **Node Addition:** Scale up from 0 to 100% with spring easing (Duration: 300ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55))
- **Connection Creation:** Draw line from start to end (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Canvas Pan:** Momentum scrolling with deceleration (Duration: 1000ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94))
- **Modal Open:** Fade in background, slide up content (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Success State:** Checkmark draw animation (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Loading State:** Pulsing opacity 0.5 to 1 (Duration: 1500ms, Easing: ease-in-out)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Initial canvas render < 1s, full load < 3s
- **Interaction Response:** < 100ms for all user actions
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations

### Design Strategies

- Virtual rendering for journeys with >50 nodes
- Lazy load node configuration panels
- Debounce search and filter operations by 300ms
- Progressive image loading for email templates
- Use CSS transforms for animations (GPU accelerated)
- Implement skeleton screens during data fetches
- Cache journey thumbnails and frequently used templates

## Next Steps
