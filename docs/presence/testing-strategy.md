# WS-204 Presence System Testing Strategy

## Overview

The WS-204 Presence Tracking System testing strategy ensures robust, reliable, and secure presence functionality for the wedding industry. This comprehensive approach validates system performance under real-world wedding scenarios while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and security.

## Test Pyramid Approach

### Unit Tests (70% Coverage)
- **Component Logic**: Individual presence components and utilities
- **Hooks Testing**: Custom React hooks for presence management
- **State Management**: Presence state updates and transitions
- **Utility Functions**: Data sanitization, validation, and formatting

### Integration Tests (20% Coverage)
- **API Integration**: WebSocket connections and REST endpoints
- **Database Integration**: Presence data persistence and retrieval
- **Third-party Services**: Authentication and notification services
- **System Integration**: Navigation and timeline system compatibility

### End-to-End Tests (10% Coverage)
- **Complete User Workflows**: Full presence tracking scenarios
- **Cross-platform Validation**: Testing across browsers and devices
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Wedding day operations and emergency situations

## Wedding-Specific Testing Scenarios

### 1. Wedding Day Operations

#### Vendor Arrival Tracking
```typescript
// Test Scenario: Vendor arrival monitoring during setup
const vendorArrivals = [
  { vendor: 'photographer', arrivalTime: '08:00', critical: true },
  { vendor: 'caterer', arrivalTime: '10:00', critical: true },
  { vendor: 'florist', arrivalTime: '11:00', critical: false },
  { vendor: 'dj', arrivalTime: '15:00', critical: true }
];
```

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Real-time arrival notifications
- Timeline synchronization
- Missing vendor alerts
- Automated backup coordination

#### Emergency Coordinator Handoff
- **Scenario**: Primary coordinator goes offline during ceremony
- **Testing**: Automatic backup coordinator activation
- **Validation**: Guest and vendor notifications sent
- **Recovery**: Seamless service continuity

### 2. Planning Phase Collaboration

#### Simultaneous Document Editing
- **Multi-user Access**: Timeline editing by couple, coordinator, photographer
- **Conflict Resolution**: Real-time synchronization and merge handling
- **Presence Awareness**: Who's editing what and when

#### Client Communication Tracking
- **Activity Monitoring**: Client consultation sessions
- **Response Time Tracking**: Vendor availability and responsiveness
- **Communication Analytics**: Interaction patterns and effectiveness

### 3. Supplier Coordination

#### Multi-Wedding Management
```typescript
// Example: Photographer working multiple weddings
const supplierSchedule = {
  photographer: 'photographer-123',
  activeWeddings: [
    { id: 'morning-wedding', time: '10:00-14:00', status: 'active' },
    { id: 'evening-wedding', time: '18:00-23:00', status: 'scheduled' }
  ],
  transitionTime: 30, // minutes between weddings
  currentLocation: 'wedding-morning'
};
```

**Testing Focus:**
- Handoff coordination between weddings
- Travel time calculations
- Client notification systems
- Backup photographer activation if needed

## Cross-Platform Compatibility Testing

### Offline Functionality Testing

```typescript
// Offline presence queue testing
const offlineScenarios = [
  {
    scenario: 'Network interruption during ceremony',
    duration: '5 minutes',
    expectedBehavior: 'Queue updates, sync on reconnection'
  },
  {
    scenario: 'Venue WiFi outage',
    duration: '15 minutes', 
    expectedBehavior: 'Fallback to cellular, maintain core functions'
  }
];
```
