# Database Health Monitoring - Administrator User Guide

## WS-234: Database Health Monitoring System
**Team**: team-c | **Batch**: batch1 | **Round**: round1 | **Status**: COMPLETE

## 📋 Overview
This guide provides administrators with comprehensive instructions for using the database health monitoring system to ensure optimal performance and reliability of the WedSync platform, with special emphasis on protecting wedding day operations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Accessing the Admin Dashboard
1. **Login**: Use your administrator credentials at `https://your-wedsync-domain.com/login`
2. **Navigate**: Go to **Admin** → **System Health** → **Database Metrics**
3. **URL**: Direct access at `/admin/database-metrics` (admin role required)

### Dashboard Overview
The admin dashboard is organized into four main sections:
- **Real-time Status**: Current system health and alerts
- **Performance Charts**: Historical performance trends
- **Wedding Day Status**: Saturday-specific monitoring and protections
- **Backup Verification**: Backup integrity and disaster recovery status

## 📊 Understanding the Dashboard

### 1. Real-time Status Panel

#### Health Status Indicators
- 🟢 **Healthy**: All systems operating normally
- 🟡 **Warning**: Performance degradation detected, monitoring closely
- 🔴 **Critical**: Immediate attention required, potential service impact
- ⚫ **Unknown**: Monitoring system unable to determine status

#### Key Metrics at a Glance
```
┌─ Connection Pool ─────────────────┐
│ Active: 12/20 (60%)               │
│ Waiting: 0                        │
│ Status: Healthy ✓                 │
└───────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ Query Performance ───────────────┐
│ Avg Response: 145ms               │
│ Slow Queries: 3 (last hour)      │
│ Status: Warning ⚠                 │
└───────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ System Resources ────────────────┐
│ CPU: 45% | Memory: 67%            │
│ Disk: 32% | Network: 23ms        │
│ Status: Healthy ✓                 │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Performance Charts Section

#### Connection Pool Utilization Chart
**What it shows**: Database connection usage over time
**Normal range**: 20-80% utilization
**Wedding day range**: Should stay below 70%

**Interpretation**:
- **Steady line around 40-60%**: Healthy operation
- **Frequent spikes to 90%+**: Potential connection leaks or high load
- **Consistently high (80%+)**: May need connection pool size increase

#### Query Response Time Chart
**What it shows**: Average database query response times
**Normal threshold**: <500ms average
**Wedding day threshold**: <250ms average

**Interpretation**:
- **Consistent low times (<200ms)**: Excellent performance
- **Gradual increase over time**: May indicate need for query optimization
- **Sharp spikes**: Investigate specific slow queries in the alerts panel

#### System Resource Usage Charts
**CPU, Memory, Disk, and Network charts**

**CPU Usage**:
- **Normal**: <70%
- **Wedding Day**: <60%
- **Critical**: >90%

**Memory Usage**:
- **Normal**: <80%
- **Wedding Day**: <75%
- **Critical**: >95%

### 3. Wedding Day Status Panel

#### Saturday Detection
The system automatically detects when it's Saturday and activates enhanced monitoring:

```
┌─ Wedding Day Status ──────────────┐
│ Today: Saturday ✓                 │
│ Enhanced Monitoring: Active       │
│ Strict Thresholds: Enabled        │
│ Peak Hours: 2:00 PM (High Risk)   │
│ Active Weddings: 23               │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Peak Wedding Hours
The system identifies high-risk hours when most weddings occur:
- **11:00 AM - 1:00 PM**: Ceremony preparation
- **1:00 PM - 4:00 PM**: Peak ceremony time (highest risk)
- **4:00 PM - 8:00 PM**: Reception setup
- **8:00 PM - 11:00 PM**: Reception peak

#### Vendor Impact Assessment
Shows how current performance issues might affect wedding vendors:
- **Minimal**: Vendors unlikely to notice performance issues
- **Moderate**: Some vendors may experience slower response times
- **Severe**: Vendors will definitely notice; may impact wedding operations

### 4. Alerts and Notifications Panel

#### Alert Levels
- **Info** 🔵: General information, no action required
- **Warning** 🟡: Performance degradation, monitor closely
- **Critical** 🔴: Immediate action required
- **Emergency** ⚫: Wedding day critical issue, all hands on deck

#### Recent Alerts Example
```
⚫ EMERGENCY | 2:15 PM | Wedding day database response >1000ms
🔴 CRITICAL  | 2:10 PM | Connection pool utilization 95%
🟡 WARNING   | 2:05 PM | Slow query detected: guest list export
🔵 INFO      | 2:00 PM | Backup verification completed successfully
```

### 5. Backup Verification Status

#### Backup Health Overview
```
┌─ Backup Status ───────────────────┐
│ Last Backup: 2 hours ago ✓        │
│ Verification: Passed ✓            │
│ Integrity: 100% ✓                 │

3. **Standard Priority**: All other active vendors

#### Emergency Escalation
If issues persist for more than 15 minutes on Saturday:
1. Automatic escalation to senior technical team
2. Vendor notification system activates
3. Emergency recovery procedures begin
4. Status page updates automatically

## 📈 Performance Monitoring Best Practices

### Daily Monitoring Routine
**Every Morning (9 AM)**:
1. Check overnight alerts in the dashboard
2. Review backup verification status
3. Look at performance trend charts
4. If it's Saturday, verify wedding day mode is active

**Key Questions to Ask**:
- Are all systems showing "Healthy" status?
- Has the nightly backup completed successfully?
- Are there any concerning trends in the performance charts?
- Is today Saturday, and is wedding day monitoring active?

### Weekly Review Process
**Every Monday Morning**:
1. Review the previous week's performance trends
2. Analyze any alerts or incidents
3. Check backup verification compliance
4. Review weekend (Saturday) performance specifically

### Monthly Deep Dive
**First Monday of each month**:
1. Analyze performance trends over the full month
2. Review disaster recovery test results
3. Update emergency contact information
4. Review and update alert thresholds if needed
