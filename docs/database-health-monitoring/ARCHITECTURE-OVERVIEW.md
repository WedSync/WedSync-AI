## 🔄 Data Flow Architecture

### Health Check Request Flow
```
1. API Request → Rate Limiting → Authentication Check
2. Request Type Detection (quick/full/wedding-day/metrics)
3. Cache Check (Redis) → Return if valid cache
4. Health Monitor Execution → Database Queries
5. Metrics Processing → Alert Evaluation
6. Response Formatting → Cache Storage → Client Response
```

### Wedding Day Emergency Flow
```
1. Saturday Detection → Strict Threshold Activation
2. Performance Degradation Detected → Alert Classification
3. Emergency Level Assessment → Escalation Decision
4. Vendor Impact Analysis → Notification Preparation
5. Multi-channel Notifications (Email/SMS/Webhooks)
6. Recovery Procedure Initiation → Progress Monitoring
7. Post-incident Reporting → Lessons Learned Documentation
```

### Backup Verification Flow
```
1. Scheduled Trigger (Daily 2 AM) → Backup Discovery
2. Inventory Creation → Integrity Verification
3. Deep Content Validation → Wedding Data Verification
4. Cross-region Consistency Check → Recovery Testing
5. Report Generation → Alert on Failures
6. Compliance Assessment → Retention Policy Check
```

## 🏛️ Database Schema Integration

### Existing WedSync Tables Used
- **weddings**: Wedding date analysis for Saturday detection
- **bookings**: Vendor schedule optimization
- **guests**: Guest list performance monitoring
- **venues**: Venue availability query optimization
- **user_profiles**: Authentication and user activity tracking

### New Monitoring Tables Created
```sql
-- Health monitoring audit and history
CREATE TABLE health_monitoring_audit (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  metrics JSONB NOT NULL,
  alerts JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
  check_type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'standard'
);

-- Backup verification tracking
CREATE TABLE backup_verification_audit (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  backup_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  verification_status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  verification_time TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  file_size BIGINT,
  checksum_valid BOOLEAN
);
```

## 🚀 Performance Architecture

### Caching Strategy
**Three-tier caching system**:

1. **L1 Cache (In-Memory)**: Singleton class instances with cached state
   - Duration: 30 seconds
   - Use case: Repeated calls within same request cycle

2. **L2 Cache (Redis)**: Structured health metrics and query results
   - Duration: 60 seconds (normal), 30 seconds (wedding day)
   - Use case: Cross-request caching, API response optimization

3. **L3 Cache (Database)**: Aggregated metrics and historical trends
   - Duration: 5 minutes
   - Use case: Dashboard charts, trend analysis

### Connection Pool Optimization
- **Primary Pool**: 20 connections for application queries
- **Monitoring Pool**: 5 dedicated connections for health checks
- **Emergency Pool**: 3 reserved connections for wedding day incidents
- **Connection Rotation**: Automatic cleanup of stale connections

### Query Optimization Strategies
- **Index-aware monitoring**: Tracks index usage and suggests improvements
- **Query plan caching**: Stores execution plans for recurring queries
- **Wedding-specific optimization**: Prioritizes wedding-related query performance
- **Bulk operation monitoring**: Special handling for large guest list operations

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Admin Dashboard**: Requires authenticated admin role
- **API Endpoints**: Rate-limited with optional authentication
- **Emergency Procedures**: Multi-factor authentication required
- **Audit Logging**: All monitoring activities logged for security audit

### Data Protection
- **PII Exclusion**: No personally identifiable information in metrics
- **Query Sanitization**: All logged queries are sanitized
- **Secure Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management
- **Encryption**: All backup verification uses encrypted connections

### Wedding Day Security Protocols
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Automatic security scanning increases on Saturdays
- **Access Logging**: Detailed logging of all system access during weddings
- **Incident Response**: Pre-defined security incident procedures
- **Vendor Communication Security**: Encrypted vendor notification channels

## 🔄 Integration Architecture
