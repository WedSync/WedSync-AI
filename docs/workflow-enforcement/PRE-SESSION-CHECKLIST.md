#!/bin/bash
# Run before creating any session prompt

echo "=== PRE-SESSION COMPLIANCE AUDIT ==="

# 1. Check CORE-SPECIFICATIONS knowledge
echo "1. CORE-SPECIFICATIONS Reading:"
find CORE-SPECIFICATIONS/ -name "*.md" | wc -l
echo "specifications available"

# 2. Verify technology choices
echo "2. Technology Verification:"
grep -c "@dnd-kit" CORE-SPECIFICATIONS/00-PROJECT-OVERVIEW/04-tech-stack-decisions.md

# 3. Check current roadmap phase
echo "3. Roadmap Phase:"
grep "Phase 2" DEVELOPMENT-ROADMAP.md | head -1

# 4. Verify root directory compliance
echo "4. Root Directory Files:"
ls -la . | wc -l
echo "files in root (must be â‰¤15)"

# 5. Check session organization
echo "5. Session Organization:"
ls -la SESSION-LOGS/ | tail -5

echo "=== COMPLIANCE AUDIT COMPLETE ==="
```

### **POST-SESSION VERIFICATION**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run after session completion claims

echo "=== POST-SESSION VERIFICATION ==="

# 1. Test build status
cd wedsync && npm run build
echo "Build Status: $?"

# 2. Run tests
cd wedsync && npm run test -- --coverage
echo "Test Status: $?"

# 3. Check for new root files
ls -la . | grep -E "\.md$" | grep -v -E "(PM-|WORKFLOW|PROJECT|DEVELOPMENT|SECURITY|PRICING)"
echo "Unauthorized root files: $?"

# 4. Verify screenshots exist
find SESSION-LOGS/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/ -name "*.png" | wc -l
echo "Screenshot evidence files"

echo "=== VERIFICATION COMPLETE ==="
```

## âš¡ QUICK COMPLIANCE CHECK

**Before creating ANY session prompt:**

1. âœ… Read CORE-SPECIFICATIONS for feature area
2. âœ… Verify tech stack choices match specifications  
3. âœ… Plan 6+ parallel agents with specific assignments
4. âœ… Include comprehensive technical context
5. âœ… Specify verification evidence requirements
6. âœ… Add cleanup and reporting procedures

**VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE WORKFLOW STOPPAGE**

**This checklist ensures PM operates at enterprise standards, not hobby project level.**
