## Wedding Season Operations

### Pre-Season Preparation (April)

**Infrastructure Scaling:**
1. **Redis Cluster Health Check**
   ```bash
   # Run comprehensive cluster health assessment
   ./scripts/redis-cluster-health-check.sh
   
   # Expected output: All nodes GREEN, <50ms latency
   # Action required if: Any node YELLOW or RED status
   ```

2. **Capacity Planning**
   ```bash
   # Analyze previous year's peak traffic
   ./scripts/wedding-season-capacity-analysis.sh
   
   # Review and adjust tier limits based on growth
   ./scripts/update-seasonal-multipliers.sh 2.5  # 25% increase from last year
   ```

3. **Load Testing**
   ```bash
   # Run wedding season simulation
   npm run test:load-wedding-season
   
   # Validate 500+ concurrent users performance
   # Verify <5ms response times under peak load
   ```

## Emergency Procedures

### Redis Cluster Failure

**Symptoms:**
- Rate limiting falls back to in-memory (per-server)
- Uneven load distribution across servers
- Some users may experience inconsistent limits

**Immediate Response (2-minute procedure):**

1. **Verify Failure (0-30 seconds):**
   ```bash
   # Check Redis cluster status
   redis-cli -c cluster info
   
   # Expected: cluster_state:fail or connection timeout
   ```

2. **Activate Memory Fallback (30-60 seconds):**
   ```bash
   # Ensure fallback is active (should be automatic)
   ./scripts/verify-memory-fallback.sh
   
   # Temporarily reduce limits to prevent server overload
   ./scripts/reduce-fallback-limits.sh 0.7x
   ```

3. **Begin Recovery (1-2 minutes):**
   ```bash
   # Attempt cluster recovery
   ./scripts/redis-cluster-recovery.sh
   
   # If recovery fails, failover to backup cluster
   ./scripts/failover-to-backup-cluster.sh
   ```

**Post-Recovery Actions:**
- Run full cluster health check
- Verify data consistency across nodes
- Restore normal rate limits gradually
- Document incident for post-mortem

### DDoS Attack Response

**Identification Criteria:**
- Sudden spike in requests from single IP/org
- Requests bypass normal user behavior patterns
- Response times increase across the platform

**Response Procedure (3-minute response):**

1. **Immediate Block (0-1 minute):**
   ```bash
   # Block attacking IP/organization
   ./scripts/emergency-ip-block.sh [ATTACKER_IP]
   
   # Enable strict rate limiting
   ./scripts/enable-strict-mode.sh
   ```

2. **Analysis and Expansion (1-2 minutes):**
   ```bash
   # Analyze attack pattern
   ./scripts/analyze-attack-pattern.sh
   
   # Block attack subnet if distributed
   ./scripts/block-subnet.sh [SUBNET_RANGE]
   ```

3. **Platform Protection (2-3 minutes):**
   ```bash
   # Reduce limits for all free tier users
   ./scripts/emergency-free-tier-limits.sh 0.5x
   
   # Enable enhanced logging
   ./scripts/enable-attack-logging.sh
   ```

### Data Scraping Detection

**Automated Detection Triggers:**
- Rapid, sequential requests across multiple endpoints
- Requests for large datasets outside normal vendor patterns
- Attempts to access competitor data

**Response Actions:**
```bash
# Automatically triggered by system:
./scripts/scraping-response.sh [ORG_ID]

# This script:
# 1. Reduces org limits to 10% of normal
# 2. Enables enhanced logging for the organization
# 3. Alerts security team
# 4. Requires manual review to restore normal limits
```
