# Customer Journey Builder - Complete Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Customer Journey Builder is a visual automation system that lets wedding suppliers create automated workflows for client communication and task management. Think of it like a flowchart that automatically sends emails, assigns tasks, and manages the entire client experience from booking to post-wedding.
