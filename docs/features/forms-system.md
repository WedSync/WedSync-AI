- Real-time preview on the right side
- Mobile preview toggle button

#### Field Palette (Left Sidebar)
**Basic Fields**:
- Single Line Text (name, email, phone)
- Multi-line Text Area (notes, special requests)

## Testing Checklist for Claude Code

1. Create a basic contact form with 5 fields
2. Add conditional logic to show/hide fields
3. Link form to core fields and verify auto-population
4. Test form on mobile device
5. Submit form and verify data storage
6. Check email notifications work
7. Export responses to CSV
8. Create multi-page form with progress bar
9. Test save and resume functionality
10. Verify analytics tracking is accurate

## Common Issues to Prevent

1. Don't allow form deletion if has responses (archive instead)
2. Validate email fields properly (use standard regex)
3. Prevent duplicate submissions (use session tokens)
4. Handle file upload size limits gracefully
5. Show clear error messages for validation failures
6. Auto-save form builder work to prevent loss
7. Test timezone handling for date/time fields
8. Ensure accessibility standards are met

## Priority Implementation Order
