# Real-Time Sync System - Complete Implementation Guide

## Overview
The real-time sync system ensures that when any data changes anywhere in WedSync/WedMe, it instantly updates across all connected users and interfaces. When a couple updates their wedding date in WedMe, all connected suppliers see it immediately. When a supplier adds a note, their team sees it instantly.

## Core Components

### 1. WebSocket Connection Manager
**Location**: `/app/lib/realtime/connection-manager.ts`

#### Connection Establishment
**Sub-agent instructions**: Create persistent connection system:

**Connection Flow**:
1. User logs in to platform
2. WebSocket connection opens automatically
3. Connection authenticated with user token
4. User subscribes to relevant channels
5. Heartbeat starts (every 30 seconds)
6. Reconnection on disconnect (exponential backoff)

**Connection States**:
- Connecting (yellow indicator)
- Connected (green indicator)
- Disconnected (red indicator)
- Reconnecting (yellow pulsing)
- Error (red with retry button)

#### Visual Connection Indicator
**Sub-agent instructions**: Add status indicator to UI:

**Location in UI**: Top-right corner of dashboard
- Green dot = Connected and syncing
- Yellow dot = Connecting or slow connection
- Red dot = Disconnected
- Click for details and manual reconnect

### 2. Channel Architecture

#### Channel Types
**Sub-agent instructions**: Implement Supabase Realtime channels:

3. Test couple updating wedding date, check supplier sees it
4. Disconnect internet, make changes, reconnect and verify sync
5. Have two users edit same field simultaneously
6. Test with 10+ users in same wedding
7. Verify mobile sync works properly
8. Test notification delivery across devices
