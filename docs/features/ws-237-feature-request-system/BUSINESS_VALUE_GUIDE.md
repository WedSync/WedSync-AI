# WS-237 Feature Request Management System - Business Value Guide

## Executive Summary for Wedding Industry Stakeholders

The WS-237 Feature Request Management System is like having a dedicated wedding industry consultant who understands your business inside and out—someone who knows that when a venue's payment system goes down 5 days before a wedding, it's not just a "feature request," it's a business emergency that could cost £50,000 in lost bookings.

This system transforms how WedSync listens to and responds to wedding vendor needs, delivering **measurable ROI** through faster feature development, reduced support overhead, and improved vendor retention.
