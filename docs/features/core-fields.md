Core Fields System Documentation
Overview
The Core Fields system is WedSync's revolutionary feature that eliminates repetitive data entry. Couples enter their wedding information once in WedMe, and it automatically populates across all supplier forms. This is what makes WedSync different from generic form builders.
Core Concept
Think of Core Fields as "universal wedding data" that every supplier needs. Instead of couples typing "June 15, 2025" into 14 different vendor forms, they enter it once and it flows everywhere.

Field States System
Status Indicators
Each field has a completion status that shows across the platform:
‚úÖ Completed - Field has been filled with valid data
üü° Partial - Field partially complete or needs review
‚ö™ Pending - Field not yet filled
‚ùå Not Applicable - Field not relevant for this wedding
üîí Locked - Field locked by supplier (can't be edited)
Validation States

Valid - Data meets all requirements
Invalid - Data fails validation rules
Outdated - Data hasn't been confirmed recently
Conflicting - Different sources show different data

Auto-Population Flow
How It Works

Couple enters data once in WedMe dashboard
System validates and stores in core fields table
When supplier creates form, they mark fields as "core fields"
When couple accesses form, core fields auto-fill
Updates sync across all connected systems

Implementation for Claude Code
markdown## For Sub-Agent: Core Fields Manager

### Task: Implement Core Field Auto-Population
1. Create database table: `core_fields`
   - couple_id (foreign key)
   - field_name (from list above)
   - field_value (JSON for flexibility)
   - last_updated
   - updated_by
   - validation_status

2. Create API endpoints:
   - GET /api/core-fields/{couple_id}
   - PUT /api/core-fields/{couple_id}/{field_name}
   - POST /api/core-fields/validate
   - GET /api/core-fields/completion-status/{couple_id}

3. Create React components:
   - CoreFieldIndicator (shows ‚úÖüü°‚ö™‚ùå status)
   - CoreFieldInput (smart input with validation)
   - CoreFieldsSummary (dashboard widget)
   - CoreFieldsProgress (completion percentage)

4. Implement auto-population:
   - When form loads, fetch core fields
   - Match form fields to core field names
   - Pre-fill matching fields
   - Lock fields if supplier configured as read-only
   - Show indicator that field is auto-populated
Supplier Form Integration
Marking Fields as Core Fields
When suppliers build forms, they can:

Link to core field - Field auto-populates
Copy from core field - Initial value from core, but editable
Independent field - Not connected to core fields
Override core field - Allow couple to update core field

Visual Indicators in Form Builder
[Wedding Date] üîÑ ‚Üê Shows this is a core field
[Special Request] ‚Üê Regular field, no indicator
