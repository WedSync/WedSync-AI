# SOC2 Audit Procedures Manual - Wedding Industry Platform

## Executive Summary

This manual provides comprehensive SOC2 Type II audit procedures specifically designed for WedSync's wedding industry platform. The procedures address the five Trust Services Criteria (Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy) with special emphasis on wedding industry requirements including guest data protection, vendor financial security, and wedding day operational integrity.

**Audit Scope**: All systems, processes, and controls supporting wedding coordination, vendor management, guest data processing, and financial transactions.

**Audit Period**: 12 months ending [Date]

**Industry Focus**: Wedding technology platform serving photographers, venues, planners, and couples globally.

## Trust Services Criteria Implementation

### Security (TSC CC6.0)

The system is protected against unauthorized access (both physical and logical).

#### Control Objective: Access Controls for Wedding Data

**Control ID**: SEC-001  
**Control Description**: Multi-layered access controls prevent unauthorized access to wedding guest data, vendor information, and financial records.

**Wedding Industry Context**: Wedding vendors require access to specific client data while maintaining strict isolation from competitors' information. Guest data includes sensitive dietary and medical information requiring special protection.

##### Testing Procedures

**Automated Testing** (Daily):
```bash
# Access Control Validation Script
#!/bin/bash

echo "Testing wedding data access controls..."

# Test 1: Vendor data isolation
curl -X GET "${API_BASE}/api/weddings/all" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${VENDOR_TOKEN}" \
  -w "%{http_code}" | grep -q "403" || echo "FAIL: Cross-vendor access not blocked"

# Test 2: Guest data encryption
psql -d wedding_db -c "SELECT pg_column_is_updatable('guest_info', 'dietary_requirements');" | grep -q "f" || echo "FAIL: Guest data not properly encrypted"

# Test 3: Photo gallery access controls  
curl -X GET "${API_BASE}/api/photos/wedding-123/all" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${UNAUTHORIZED_TOKEN}" \
  -w "%{http_code}" | grep -q "401" || echo "FAIL: Photo access not restricted"
```

**Manual Testing** (Weekly):
1. **Role-Based Access Testing**:
   - Create test vendor account with limited permissions
   - Attempt to access competitor's wedding data
   - Verify access denied and attempt logged
   - Document test results with screenshots

2. **Privilege Escalation Testing**:
   - Attempt to modify user role through API manipulation
   - Test horizontal privilege escalation between vendors
   - Verify administrative functions properly protected
   - Record all security events in audit log

**Evidence Collection**:
- Access attempt logs with timestamps and IP addresses
- Role assignment matrix with approval documentation
- Failed authentication statistics and analysis
- Privilege escalation attempt detection reports

#### Control Objective: Wedding Photo Intellectual Property Protection

**Control ID**: SEC-002  
**Control Description**: Digital watermarking, access logging, and copyright protection for wedding photography assets.

##### Testing Procedures

**Automated Testing** (Daily):
```typescript
// Photo IP Protection Test Suite
async function testPhotoIPProtection() {
  const testResults = {
    watermarkingActive: false,
    accessLogged: false,
    copyrightMetadata: false,
    unauthorizedDownloadBlocked: false
  };

  // Test watermarking implementation
  const photoResponse = await fetch('/api/photos/test-wedding/preview');
  const photoBuffer = await photoResponse.buffer();
  testResults.watermarkingActive = await detectWatermark(photoBuffer);

  // Test access logging
  const accessLogs = await queryAccessLogs('photo_access', 'last_hour');
  testResults.accessLogged = accessLogs.length > 0;

  // Test copyright metadata
  const metadata = await extractPhotoMetadata(photoBuffer);
  testResults.copyrightMetadata = metadata.copyright !== null;

  // Test unauthorized download protection
  const unauthorizedResponse = await fetch('/api/photos/download/bulk', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer invalid_token' }
  });
  testResults.unauthorizedDownloadBlocked = unauthorizedResponse.status === 403;

  return testResults;
}
```

**Evidence Collection**:
- Photo processing logs showing watermark application
- Copyright metadata extraction reports
- Unauthorized access attempt logs
- Digital rights management compliance reports

### Availability (TSC CC7.0)

The system is available for operation and use as committed or agreed.

#### Control Objective: Wedding Day Uptime SLA (99.9%)

**Control ID**: AVL-001  
**Control Description**: System maintains 99.9% uptime with zero tolerance for outages during wedding events (especially Saturdays).

**Wedding Industry Context**: Wedding day system outages can cause irreparable damage to vendor businesses and couple experiences. Saturday outages are particularly critical as 60%+ of weddings occur on Saturdays.

##### Testing Procedures

**Real-time Monitoring** (Continuous):
```python
# Wedding Day Uptime Monitor
import datetime
import requests
from prometheus_client import Gauge

wedding_day_uptime = Gauge('wedding_day_uptime_percent', 'Wedding day uptime percentage')
saturday_incident_count = Gauge('saturday_incident_count', 'Number of Saturday incidents')

def monitor_wedding_day_uptime():
    """Monitor system uptime with special focus on wedding days"""
    current_time = datetime.datetime.now()
    is_weekend = current_time.weekday() >= 5  # Saturday = 5, Sunday = 6
    is_wedding_season = 5 <= current_time.month <= 10  # May-October
    
    # Enhanced monitoring during critical periods
    if is_weekend and is_wedding_season:
        check_interval = 30  # 30 seconds during wedding days
        alert_threshold = 99.9
    else:
        check_interval = 300  # 5 minutes during normal operations
        alert_threshold = 99.5
    
    # Perform uptime checks
    uptime_checks = [
        check_api_endpoints(),
        check_database_connectivity(),
        check_photo_upload_service(),
        check_payment_processing(),
        check_vendor_portal()
    ]
    
    uptime_percentage = sum(uptime_checks) / len(uptime_checks) * 100
    wedding_day_uptime.set(uptime_percentage)
    
    if uptime_percentage < alert_threshold:
        trigger_wedding_day_emergency_response()
        
    return uptime_percentage

def check_wedding_specific_functionality():
    """Test wedding-specific system components"""
    tests = {
        'guest_rsvp_system': test_rsvp_functionality(),
        'vendor_communication': test_vendor_messaging(),
        'timeline_coordination': test_timeline_updates(),
        'photo_gallery': test_photo_upload_download(),
        'payment_processing': test_vendor_payments()
    }
    return tests
```

**Evidence Collection**:
- Hourly uptime reports with wedding day emphasis
- Incident response time metrics for weekend events

#### Control Objective: Vendor Payment Calculation Accuracy

**Control ID**: PI-001  
**Control Description**: All vendor payments, commissions, and fees are calculated accurately with automated validation and reconciliation.

**Wedding Industry Context**: Payment errors can severely damage vendor relationships and cash flow. Commission calculations must account for complex wedding packages, seasonal rates, and multi-vendor coordination fees.

##### Testing Procedures

**Daily Payment Validation**:
```sql
-- Vendor Payment Accuracy Validation Queries

-- Test 1: Commission calculation accuracy
SELECT 
    v.vendor_id,
    v.vendor_name,
    SUM(t.transaction_amount) as total_revenue,
    SUM(t.commission_amount) as calculated_commission,
    SUM(t.transaction_amount * v.commission_rate) as expected_commission,
    CASE 
        WHEN ABS(SUM(t.commission_amount) - SUM(t.transaction_amount * v.commission_rate)) > 0.01 
        THEN 'FAIL' 
        ELSE 'PASS' 
    END as accuracy_test
FROM vendors v
JOIN transactions t ON v.vendor_id = t.vendor_id
WHERE t.transaction_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY v.vendor_id, v.vendor_name, v.commission_rate
HAVING accuracy_test = 'FAIL';

-- Test 2: Tax calculation verification
SELECT 
    t.transaction_id,
    t.transaction_amount,
    t.tax_amount,
    t.jurisdiction,
    tr.standard_rate as expected_tax_rate,
    (t.transaction_amount * tr.standard_rate) as expected_tax_amount,
    CASE 
        WHEN ABS(t.tax_amount - (t.transaction_amount * tr.standard_rate)) > 0.01 
        THEN 'FAIL' 
        ELSE 'PASS' 
    END as tax_accuracy
FROM transactions t
JOIN tax_rates tr ON t.jurisdiction = tr.jurisdiction
WHERE t.transaction_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'
AND tax_accuracy = 'FAIL';

-- Test 3: Payment reconciliation
SELECT 
    p.payment_id,
    p.vendor_id,
    p.calculated_amount,
    p.actual_payment_amount,
    ABS(p.calculated_amount - p.actual_payment_amount) as variance,
    CASE 
        WHEN ABS(p.calculated_amount - p.actual_payment_amount) > 0.01 
        THEN 'RECONCILIATION_FAIL' 
        ELSE 'RECONCILIATION_PASS' 
    END as reconciliation_status
FROM payments p
WHERE p.payment_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'
AND reconciliation_status = 'RECONCILIATION_FAIL';
```

**Evidence Collection**:
- Daily payment calculation validation reports
- Commission accuracy testing results  
- Tax calculation verification logs

```typescript
// Guest Data Completeness Validation
interface GuestDataQualityReport {
  totalGuests: number;
  completeProfiles: number;
  missingRequiredFields: number;
  invalidDataFormats: number;
  duplicateEntries: number;
  dataQualityScore: number;
}

async function validateGuestDataQuality(weddingId: string): Promise<GuestDataQualityReport> {
  const guests = await database.query(
    'SELECT * FROM guests WHERE wedding_id = $1', [weddingId]
  );
  
  let report: GuestDataQualityReport = {
    totalGuests: guests.length,
    completeProfiles: 0,
    missingRequiredFields: 0,
    invalidDataFormats: 0,
    duplicateEntries: 0,
    dataQualityScore: 0
  };
  
  for (const guest of guests) {
    // Check required field completeness
    const requiredFields = ['name', 'email', 'rsvp_status'];
    const missingFields = requiredFields.filter(field => !guest[field]);
    
    if (missingFields.length === 0) {
      report.completeProfiles++;
    } else {
      report.missingRequiredFields++;
    }
    
    // Validate data formats
    if (!isValidEmail(guest.email)) report.invalidDataFormats++;
    if (!isValidPhoneNumber(guest.phone)) report.invalidDataFormats++;
    
    // Check for duplicates
    const duplicates = guests.filter(g => 
      g.id !== guest.id && 
      (g.email === guest.email || 
       (g.name === guest.name && g.phone === guest.phone))
    );
    if (duplicates.length > 0) report.duplicateEntries++;
  }
  
  report.dataQualityScore = (report.completeProfiles / report.totalGuests) * 100;
  return report;
}

// Wedding-specific validation rules
function validateWeddingSpecificData(guest: Guest): ValidationResult {
  const violations: string[] = [];
  
  // Dietary restrictions validation
  if (guest.dietary_requirements) {
    const allergens = ['peanut', 'shellfish', 'gluten', 'dairy'];
    const medicalTerms = ['diabetes', 'hypertension', 'medication'];
    
    if (containsAnyTerm(guest.dietary_requirements, allergens)) {
      // Requires special handling as medical data
      if (!guest.medical_data_consent) {
        violations.push('Medical dietary data requires explicit consent');
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Accessibility needs validation
  if (guest.accessibility_needs && !guest.accessibility_consent) {
    violations.push('Accessibility data requires explicit consent');
  }
  
  // Plus-one validation
  if (guest.plus_one_status && !guest.plus_one_details) {
    violations.push('Plus-one details required when plus-one status is true');
  }
  
  return {
    valid: violations.length === 0,
    violations: violations
  };
}
```

### Confidentiality (TSC CC6.7)

    }
    
    # Test database field encryption
    engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
    
    # Check if sensitive fields are encrypted at rest
    query = """
    SELECT 
        column_name,
        is_nullable,
        data_type,
        column_default
    FROM information_schema.columns 
    WHERE table_name = 'guests' 
    AND column_name IN ('dietary_requirements', 'medical_information', 'accessibility_needs');
    """
    
    result = engine.execute(query)
    for row in result:

            test_results[f"{row.column_name}_encrypted"] = True
    
    # Test encryption key rotation
    key_rotation_log = engine.execute(
        "SELECT * FROM encryption_key_rotations WHERE rotation_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'"
    )
    test_results['encryption_key_rotation'] = key_rotation_log.rowcount > 0
    
    # Test access logging
    access_logs = engine.execute(
        "SELECT * FROM data_access_logs WHERE table_name = 'guests' AND access_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'"
    )
    test_results['access_logging_active'] = access_logs.rowcount > 0
    
    return test_results

def test_consent_management():
    """Test consent collection and withdrawal for sensitive data"""
    
    test_scenarios = [
        {
            'scenario': 'dietary_consent_collection',
            'test': lambda: verify_explicit_consent('dietary_requirements'),

            'expected': True
        },
        {
            'scenario': 'granular_consent_options',
            'test': lambda: verify_granular_consent_options(),
            'expected': True
        }
    ]
    
    results = {}
    for scenario in test_scenarios:
        try:
            results[scenario['scenario']] = scenario['test']() == scenario['expected']
        except Exception as e:
            results[scenario['scenario']] = False
            
    return results
```

### Privacy (TSC CC6.8)
