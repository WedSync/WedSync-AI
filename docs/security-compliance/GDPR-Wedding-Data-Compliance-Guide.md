The wedding industry handles highly personal and sensitive data including guest information, dietary restrictions, medical needs, and private communications. This guide ensures full compliance with EU General Data Protection Regulation requirements while maintaining the operational needs of wedding professionals.

## Data Protection Legal Framework

### Primary Legal Bases for Wedding Data Processing

##### 2. Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
Required for transfers to non-adequate countries:

```
Wedding Industry SCC Implementation:

2. Implement SCCs: EU Commission approved clauses
3. Transfer Impact Assessment: Evaluate destination country laws
4. Additional Safeguards: Encryption, access controls, audit monitoring
5. Documentation: Record all transfer decisions and safeguards
```

##### 3. Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)
For multinational wedding company groups:
- Requires regulatory approval

- Guest rights enforcement mechanisms

#### Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA)

For each international wedding, conduct TIA:

4. **Enforcement**: Are there legal remedies available for violations?

##### Risk Mitigation Measures

  exceptions: {
    contractPerformance: boolean;
    legalObligation: boolean;
    publicInterest: boolean;
  };
  processingDecision: {
    approved: boolean;
    reasoning: string;
    alternativeOffered: 'anonymization' | 'restriction' | 'none';
  };
}
```

#### Erasure Implementation Strategy

- Determine anonymization possibilities
- Generate alternative options for guest

##### Phase 3: Selective Erasure (Within 30 days)

- Maintain minimal essential data with clear justification
- Document all decisions and communications

### Right to Data Portability (Article 20)
