## 🎯 Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

### MVP Launch (Week 4)
**GO if:**
- PDF import works for 90% of documents
- Form builder loads in <1 second
- Payment processing functional
- 10 beta users validated core value
- Critical bugs fixed

**NO-GO if:**
- Data loss incidents
- Security vulnerabilities
- <80% uptime in testing
- Payment processing fails
- Beta user NPS <30

---

## 📝 Reality Check

**This is a 12-18 month project being compressed into 3 months.**

Success requires:
1. **Ruthless prioritization** - MVP truly minimal
2. **Parallel development** - 15 agents working simultaneously
3. **Technical shortcuts** - Accept technical debt
4. **User feedback loops** - Daily iterations
5. **Market validation** - Confirm before building

**The platform is comparable to:**
- **Typeform** - $135M valuation
- **JotForm** - $500M+ valuation
- **HoneyBook** - $2.4B valuation
- **Dubsado** - $20M+ ARR

**We're building a potential unicorn. Let's treat it as such.**
