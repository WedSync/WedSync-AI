## üöÄ Getting Started

### What are Environment Variables?

Environment variables are secure configuration settings that control how your wedding business systems operate. Think of them as the "settings" that tell your website, payment processing, email system, and other tools how to work properly.

**Common Examples:**
- **Payment Processing**: Your Stripe keys that handle wedding payments
- **Email System**: Settings for sending booking confirmations and reminders
- **Photo Storage**: Credentials for storing and sharing wedding photos
- **Calendar Integration**: Settings for syncing wedding dates and appointments

### Why This Matters for Your Wedding Business

Properly configured environment variables ensure:
- ‚úÖ **Payments process correctly** during peak wedding season
- ‚úÖ **Emails reach couples** with booking confirmations and updates
- ‚úÖ **Photos are stored securely** and accessible when needed
- ‚úÖ **Integrations work smoothly** with tools like Tave, HoneyBook, or calendar apps

### Accessing the System

1. **Desktop**: Navigate to the Environment Variables section in your WedSync dashboard
2. **Mobile**: Use the mobile app's Configuration section for on-the-go management
3. **Tablet**: The responsive design works perfectly on tablets for venue management
