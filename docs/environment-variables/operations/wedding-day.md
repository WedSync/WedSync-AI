# Wedding Day Operations Runbook

## üö® CRITICAL: Saturday Operations Protocol

**ZERO TOLERANCE FOR SYSTEM DISRUPTION ON WEDDING DAYS**

This runbook covers all procedures for operating the Environment Variables Management System during wedding days (primarily Saturdays). Wedding days require maximum system stability with zero tolerance for disruption.

## üõ°Ô∏è Protection Mechanisms

### Automatic Read-Only Mode

```typescript
// System automatically detects Saturday and blocks modifications
if (new Date().getDay() === 6) {
  // Saturday = Wedding Day
  if (classificationLevel >= 6) {
    return {
      allowed: false,
      reason: 'Wedding day protection active - modifications blocked',
      requires_emergency_override: true
    }
  }
}
```

### Classification Level Protection

| Classification | Saturday Access | Override Required |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| 0-5 (PUBLIC-TOP_SECRET) | ‚úÖ Full Access | No |
| 6 (BUSINESS_CRITICAL) | ‚ùå Read Only | Yes |
| 7 (PAYMENT_SENSITIVE) | ‚ùå Read Only | Yes |
| 8 (PERSONAL_DATA) | ‚ùå Read Only | Yes |
| 9 (WEDDING_CRITICAL) | ‚ùå Read Only | Emergency Only |
| 10 (EMERGENCY_ONLY) | ‚ùå Emergency Only | Emergency Only |

## üö® Emergency Override Procedures

### When Emergency Override is Required

**ONLY use emergency override for:**
- Payment system failures affecting active weddings
- Authentication system issues preventing vendor access
- Critical infrastructure failures
- Security incidents requiring immediate action
- Data loss prevention scenarios

**NEVER use emergency override for:**
- Routine updates or maintenance
- Non-critical bug fixes
- Feature deployments
- Scheduled maintenance
- Testing or development work

### Emergency Override Process

#### Step 1: Assessment
1. **Incident Severity**: Confirm this is a genuine P0 emergency
2. **Impact Analysis**: Determine number of affected weddings
3. **Alternative Solutions**: Verify no workaround exists
4. **Risk Assessment**: Document potential risks of override vs. no action

#### Step 2: Authorization
1. **Role Verification**: Confirm user has ADMIN or WEDDING_DAY_EMERGENCY role
2. **Emergency Contact**: Identify and contact designated emergency contact
3. **Documentation**: Prepare detailed justification and rollback plan
4. **Approval**: Get explicit approval from emergency contact

#### Step 3: Override Activation
```bash
# Example override request
POST /api/environment/wedding-safety/emergency-override
{
  "action": "enable",
  "override_reason": "Payment webhook failing - active weddings cannot process payments",
  "emergency_contact_id": "contact-uuid-here",
  "severity_level": "P0",
  "estimated_duration_minutes": 30,
  "rollback_plan": "Revert webhook URL if issues persist, implement manual payment processing",
  "stakeholder_notification": true
}
```

#### Step 4: Override Operations
- **Maximum Duration**: 8 hours (system enforced)
- **Enhanced Logging**: All actions logged in detail
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring during override
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Regular updates to emergency contacts
- **Documentation**: Real-time incident documentation

#### Step 5: Override Deactivation
1. **Issue Resolution**: Confirm the emergency issue is resolved
2. **System Validation**: Verify system stability
3. **Override Disable**: Manually disable override or let it expire
4. **Post-Incident Review**: Schedule post-incident review meeting
5. **Documentation**: Complete incident report
