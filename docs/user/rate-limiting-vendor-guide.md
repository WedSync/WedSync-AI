# WedSync Usage Limits - Vendor Guide

## üéØ What This Guide Covers
This guide explains how WedSync's usage limits work and how they help ensure everyone gets fair, reliable service - especially during busy wedding season. Think of it as traffic management for your digital wedding workflow.

## üö® Quick Start - What You Need to Know

**The Bottom Line:** WedSync automatically manages usage to keep everything running smoothly, especially during peak wedding times. Most vendors never hit their limits, but understanding them helps you plan better.

**Wedding Day Promise:** On Saturdays, we give everyone extra capacity because we know wedding days can't wait.

**If You See "Please Try Again":** Just wait 30-60 seconds and try again. During busy periods (like Sunday night gallery uploads), there might be a brief queue.

## üìÖ Understanding Wedding Season Traffic

### Why We Have Usage Limits

Just like wedding venues have capacity limits to ensure quality service, WedSync has usage limits to ensure:
- **Lightning-fast performance** for everyone

- **Wedding day protection** when timing is critical

- **Wedding Season (May-September):** Overall increased activity

**How We Handle Peaks:**
- Automatically increase capacity during these times
