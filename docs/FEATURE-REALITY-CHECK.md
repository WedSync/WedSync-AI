# 🔍 WedSync Feature Reality Check
**Created:** January 18, 2025  
**Purpose:** Accurate comparison of claimed features vs actual implementation  
**Overall Completion:** 60-65% (Strong foundation, integration gaps)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CONTEXT

After analyzing the codebase, database, and documentation, there's a **significant gap** between the feature list vision and current implementation. The foundation is excellent, but many advertised features are aspirational.

Focus on connecting what's built rather than adding new features. The architecture supports everything claimed - it just needs 4-6 weeks of focused integration work.
