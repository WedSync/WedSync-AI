**Author:** John (Product Manager)

## üìã Executive Summary

### **The Problem**
Wedding vendors (photographers, venues, florists) waste 10+ hours per wedding on administrative tasks:
- Collecting the same information multiple times
- Managing forms across different systems  
- Manually updating multiple platforms
- Chasing couples for missing details
- Coordinating with other vendors inefficiently

### **The Solution**
WedSync is a B2B SaaS platform that centralizes wedding vendor operations through:
1. **Smart Form Management** - Import existing PDFs, auto-populate data
2. **Vendor Collaboration** - Share core wedding details automatically
3. **Journey Automation** - Trigger emails/SMS based on wedding timeline
4. **CRM Integration** - Sync with existing tools (Tave, HoneyBook)

### **Target Market**
- **Primary:** Wedding photographers (147,000 in US/UK)
- **Secondary:** Wedding venues, planners, florists
- **Sweet Spot:** Solo operators and small teams (1-5 people)
- **Geographic Focus:** English-speaking markets first
