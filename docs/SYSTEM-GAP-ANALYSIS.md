## 💡 **Recommendations**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **STOP all Django development** immediately
2. **FOCUS on Next.js + Supabase** only
3. **BUILD form builder first** (core functionality)
4. **DEFER CRM integrations** until after launch
5. **SIMPLIFY journey builder** for MVP

### **Quick Wins**
- Use Stripe Checkout (pre-built payment flow)
- Use SendGrid templates (faster email setup)
- Use Untitled UI + Magic UI components (avoid custom CSS)
- Use Vercel Analytics (free tier sufficient)

### **Defer Until Post-Launch**
- Advanced journey conditions
- White-label features
- API for third parties
- Mobile app
- Venue-specific features
