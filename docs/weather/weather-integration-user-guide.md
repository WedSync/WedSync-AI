## Risk Assessment Guide

### Understanding Risk Scores

The weather system calculates risk on a scale of 0-100 for each category:

**Precipitation Risk (0-100):**
- Based on probability of rain and expected amounts
- Considers timing relative to ceremony hours
- Accounts for seasonal and historical patterns

**Temperature Risk (0-100):**
- Extreme temperatures (below 0¬∞C or above 40¬∞C) = 100
- Uncomfortable ranges (below 10¬∞C or above 35¬∞C) = 60-80
- Optimal range (15-25¬∞C) = 20 or lower

**Wind Risk (0-100):**
- Light breeze (0-15 km/h) = 20
- Moderate wind (16-30 km/h) = 40
- Strong wind (31-50 km/h) = 60-80
- Dangerous wind (51+ km/h) = 100

**Visibility Risk (0-100):**
- Poor visibility affects photography and guest comfort
- Below 1km = 100, Above 10km = 10

### Overall Risk Calculation

**For Outdoor Weddings:**
- Precipitation: 40% weight
- Wind: 30% weight
- Temperature: 20% weight  
- Visibility: 10% weight

**For Indoor Weddings:**
- Temperature: 30% weight
- Visibility: 40% weight
- Precipitation: 20% weight

**Risk Level Thresholds:**
