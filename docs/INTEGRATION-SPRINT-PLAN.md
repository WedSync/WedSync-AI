# 🔌 WedSync Integration Sprint Plan
**Purpose:** Connect isolated features into working MVP  
**Timeline:** 4 weeks (Jan 20 - Feb 14, 2025)  
**Current State:** 65% built, 20% integrated  
**Target State:** 85% integrated, launch-ready MVP  
**Focus:** INTEGRATION not new features

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

### "Stop Building. Start Connecting."

You have excellent features living in isolation:
- ✅ Amazing PDF import... that doesn't connect to forms
- ✅ Beautiful form builder... that doesn't save properly  
- ✅ Sophisticated core fields... with no UI
- ✅ Payment system... that doesn't enforce limits
- ✅ Public forms... that don't submit

**The next 4 weeks are about WIRING, not BUILDING.**

## 🏗️ Integration Architecture

### The Critical Data Flow That Must Work

```
PDF Upload → OCR Processing → Field Mapping → Form Builder
                                                    ↓
Client Portal ← Public URL ← Form Publishing ← Form Settings
      ↓
Form Submission → Core Fields → Database → Vendor Dashboard
      ↓                ↓
Email Notification   Sync to Other Forms
```

### Current Breaks in the Chain
1. ❌ PDF fields don't map to form builder
2. ❌ Form builder doesn't save correctly
3. ❌ Public forms don't submit data
4. ❌ Core fields have no UI
5. ❌ Payments don't control features
6. ❌ Email service isn't connected

- Call POST /api/forms on save
- Handle optimistic updates
- Show save status
- Manage draft vs published states
```

#### 2. PDF Import → Form Creation
```typescript
// PDFImport.tsx needs to:
- After OCR, call createFormFromPDF()
- Map PDF fields to form fields
- Show mapping UI
- Save form with PDF metadata
```

#### 3. Public Form → Submission
```typescript
// PublicFormView.tsx needs to:
- Call POST /api/forms/[id]/submit
- Handle validation

- Redirect after submission
```

#### 4. Core Fields → UI
```typescript
// New CoreFieldsPanel.tsx:
