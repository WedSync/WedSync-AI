# Daily Development Log - January 15, 2025
**Session: C - Payment Processing & Journey Automation**

---

## Session Summary

Successfully restructured the entire payment system from an incorrect 3-tier model to the CORRECT 5-tier structure with GBP pricing. This was a critical pivot that ensures proper revenue generation and feature gating.

---

## What Was Built Today

### 1. Complete Payment Tier Restructure
- Migrated from 3 tiers (FREE/PRO/BUSINESS) to 5 tiers (FREE/STARTER/PROFESSIONAL/SCALE/ENTERPRISE)
- Changed pricing from USD to GBP (£19/£49/£79/£149)
- Implemented proper feature gates for each tier

### 2. Core Configuration Files
- **stripe-config.ts**: Complete tier definitions with helper functions
- **tier-limits.ts**: Updated enforcement system for 5 tiers
- **feature-gates.ts**: Access control for premium features
- **.env.example**: Documentation for all Stripe price IDs

### 3. Trial Management System
- 30-day Professional trial implementation
- Trial status checking functions
- Automatic downgrade after trial ends

---

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Tier Structure Decision
- **Why 5 tiers instead of 3**: Better market segmentation and clearer upgrade path
- **STARTER at £19**: Captures solo vendors with PDF import as key feature
- **PROFESSIONAL at £49**: Sweet spot for established vendors with AI chatbot

### 2. Feature Gate Placement
- **PDF Import at STARTER**: Makes £19 tier valuable immediately (Session B integration)
- **AI Chatbot at PROFESSIONAL**: Major differentiator for £49 tier
- **API at SCALE**: Enterprise feature for growing businesses

### 3. Implementation Approach
- Used TypeScript enums for type safety
- Centralized configuration in stripe-config.ts
- Backward compatibility with mapLegacyTier function

---

## Business Impact

### Revenue Optimization
- **Better conversion**: £19 entry point more accessible than £49
- **Clear upgrade path**: Each tier has distinct value proposition
- **Market coverage**: From solo vendors (£19) to venues (£149)

### Feature Differentiation
- **STARTER**: Unlimited forms + PDF import (core productivity)
- **PROFESSIONAL**: AI + full automation (time savings)
- **SCALE**: Team features + API (growth enablement)
- **ENTERPRISE**: White-label + venue features (enterprise needs)

### Projected Revenue (1000 customers)
- 200 × £19 = £3,800 MRR
- 600 × £49 = £29,400 MRR
- 150 × £79 = £11,850 MRR
- 50 × £149 = £7,450 MRR
- **Total: £52,500 MRR**

## Notes for Next Session

### Critical Information
1. **MUST USE 5 TIERS**: FREE, STARTER, PROFESSIONAL, SCALE, ENTERPRISE
2. **MUST USE GBP**: All prices in British Pounds (£)
3. **PDF Import from STARTER**: Not locked to higher tiers
4. **AI Chatbot from PROFESSIONAL**: Major selling point
5. **30-day trial**: All users start with Professional features

### Integration Points
- Session A needs to check `canCreateForm()` for form limits
- Session B needs to check `canUsePdfImport()` for PDF access
- Both sessions should import from `/lib/stripe-config.ts`

### Environment Setup Required
```bash
# Add to .env.local
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
STRIPE_STARTER_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_xxx
STRIPE_PROFESSIONAL_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_xxx
# ... etc for all tiers
```
