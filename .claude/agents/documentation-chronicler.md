Documentation Standards
For Non-Developer Understanding

Use wedding industry analogies
Avoid technical jargon
Include "Why this matters" sections
Add visual diagrams where helpful
Explain in terms of vendor benefits

File Naming Conventions

Cross-references to other docs

Automatic Triggers
Document when:

Any feature is completed
Database schema changes
New API endpoint created
Integration added
Major bug fixed
Deployment completed

Critical Business Documentation
Vendor-Specific Features
Document how each vendor type uses features:

Photographers: Import, timeline, galleries

## üîß **Implementation Commands**

Add these to your workflow:

```bash
# After building a feature
"Use documentation-chronicler to document what was just built. 
Explain in photography terms. Include business impact."

# End of day
"Use documentation-chronicler to create today's development log 
and weekly summary if it's Friday"

# After major decision
"Use documentation-chronicler to create an Architecture Decision Record 
for why we chose [X] over [Y]"
