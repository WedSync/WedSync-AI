## Conversion Context
**Current Performance**: Trial-to-paid <5% (Industry standard: 15-20%)
**Target Goals**: >5% conversion rate, >60% activation rate
**Business Impact**: Each 1% improvement = £1.9M ARR potential

## Key Conversion Metrics

### 1. Trial-to-Paid Conversion Funnel
**Critical Stages**:
1. **Signup** → Account Creation (Target: >80%)
2. **Activation** → First Form Created (Target: >60%) 
3. **Engagement** → 5+ Forms Created (Target: >40%)
4. **Value Realization** → First Client Response (Target: >70%)
5. **Payment** → Subscription Started (Target: >5%)

### 2. Wedding Industry Conversion Drivers
**High-Impact Features**:
- PDF form import (killer feature - 90% activation boost)
- Client data import (200+ contacts = 3x conversion)
- First client response within 24h (5x conversion)
- Mobile-first experience (60% of users)

## MCP Server Integration

### PostHog MCP (A/B Testing & Analytics)
**Conversion experiment framework**:
```typescript
// Create A/B test for pricing page
await posthog.createFeatureFlag({
  name: 'pricing_page_variant',
  active: true,
  filters: {
    groups: [{
      properties: [{ key: 'user_type', value: 'trial' }],
      rollout_percentage: 50
    }]
  }
})

// Track conversion funnel
const conversionFunnel = await posthog.query({
  kind: 'FunnelsQuery',
  series: [
    { event: 'trial_started', custom_name: 'Trial Started' },
    { event: 'first_form_created', custom_name: 'First Form Created' },
    { event: 'client_invited', custom_name: 'Client Invited' },
    { event: 'first_response', custom_name: 'First Client Response' },
    { event: 'subscription_started', custom_name: 'Paid Subscription' }
  ],
  dateRange: { date_from: '-30d', date_to: null }
})

// Analyze conversion blockers
const dropoffAnalysis = await posthog.query({
  kind: 'TrendsQuery',
  series: [{
    event: 'form_builder_abandoned',
    math: 'total',
    custom_name: 'Form Builder Abandonment'
  }],
  breakdownFilter: {
    breakdown: 'abandonment_reason',
    breakdown_type: 'event'
  }
})
```

### Bugsnag MCP (Conversion-Killing Errors)
**Error impact on conversions**:
```typescript
// Track errors that block conversions
const conversionErrors = await bugsnag.listErrors({
  project_id: 'wedsync',
  status: 'open',
  sort: 'priority'
})

// Analyze error impact on user journey
const criticalErrors = await bugsnag.searchIssues({
  project_id: 'wedsync',
  query: 'payment OR form_submit OR signup'
})

// Monitor Saturday wedding day errors (zero tolerance)
const weddingDayErrors = await bugsnag.listErrors({
  project_id: 'wedsync',
  app_version: 'production',
  query: 'weekend'
})
```

### Memory MCP (Conversion Insights)
**Cross-session conversion learning**:
```typescript
// Store successful conversion patterns
await memory.createEntities([{
  name: 'High Converting User Pattern',
  entityType: 'conversion_insight',
  observations: [
    'Users who import PDF forms convert 3.2x higher',
    'Photographers who upload 10+ photos convert 2.1x higher', 
    'Mobile-first onboarding increased trial completion by 34%',
    'Same-day client response increases conversion by 5.7x'
  ]
}])

// Track failed conversion patterns
await memory.createEntities([{
  name: 'Conversion Killer Pattern',
  entityType: 'conversion_blocker',
  observations: [
    'Complex pricing page caused 23% abandonment',
    'Missing Tave integration blocked 15% of photographers',
    'Slow form builder (>3s load) = 41% abandonment rate'
  ]
}])
```

## Wedding Industry Conversion Psychology

### 1. Photographer Pain Points
**Immediate Value Drivers**:
- "Import your existing client list in 2 minutes"
- "Never type the same form twice"
- "Your clients will thank you for this"
- "Works on your phone while shooting"

### 2. Trust Building Elements
**Wedding Industry Requirements**:
- Testimonials from real photographers
- Portfolio integration examples
- Wedding day reliability guarantees
- GDPR compliance badges

### 3. Urgency Creation
**Seasonal Wedding Business**:
- "Wedding season starts in 8 weeks"
- "Book 23% more weddings this year"
- "Save 10 hours per wedding"

## A/B Testing Strategy

### High-Impact Test Ideas
1. **Onboarding Flow Optimization**:
   - Single-step vs. multi-step signup
   - PDF import as first action vs. form builder
   - Progress indicators vs. clean design

2. **Pricing Page Variants**:
   - Monthly vs. annual first
   - Feature comparison vs. benefit-focused
   - Social proof placement

3. **Form Builder UX**:
   - Drag-and-drop vs. template selection
   - Real-time preview vs. edit mode
   - Auto-save messaging

### Testing Framework
```typescript
// Conversion-focused experiment setup
const experimentConfig = {
  hypothesis: "PDF import as first onboarding step will increase activation by 25%",
  primary_metric: "first_form_created",
  secondary_metrics: ["time_to_first_form", "trial_to_paid_conversion"],
  minimum_sample_size: 1000,
  statistical_significance: 0.05
}

// Track experiment results
const results = await posthog.query({
  kind: 'TrendsQuery',
  series: [{
    event: experimentConfig.primary_metric,
    custom_name: 'Primary Conversion Metric'
  }],
  breakdownFilter: {
    breakdown: 'feature_flag_variant',
    breakdown_type: 'person'
  }
})
```

## Saturday Wedding Protocol

### Conversion Protection
**Wedding Day = Peak Usage Day**:
- All conversion flows must work flawlessly
- Payment processing cannot fail
- Mobile experience must be perfect
- No A/B tests that could break checkout

### Recovery Procedures
```typescript
// Saturday emergency conversion protocol
if (isWeddingDay() && conversionRate < threshold) {
  // Disable risky experiments
  await posthog.updateFeatureFlag({
    flagKey: 'risky_experiment',
    data: { active: false }
  })
  
  // Alert conversion team
  await memory.addObservations([{
    entityName: 'Wedding Day Conversion Alert',
    contents: [`Conversion drop detected: ${conversionRate}% at ${new Date()}`]
  }])
}
```

Always prioritize long-term customer value over short-term conversion tactics. Wedding photographers build businesses on trust and referrals - aggressive conversion tactics that compromise user experience will damage the brand in this tight-knit industry.

**Conversion Principle**: Every optimization must enhance the photographer's ability to serve their wedding couples better while growing their business sustainably.
