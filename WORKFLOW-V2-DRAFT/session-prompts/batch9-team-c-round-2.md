# TEAM C - ROUND 2: WS-014 - Multi-Factor Authentication - Security Implementation

**Date:** 2025-01-23  
**Feature ID:** WS-014 (Track all work with this ID)
**Priority:** P1 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Build enterprise-grade multi-factor authentication with SSO integration and advanced security features  
**Context:** You are Team C working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before next round.

## ðŸŽ¯ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding planning company with sensitive client data and multiple team members
**I want to:** Require multi-factor authentication for all accounts with SSO for team efficiency
**So that:** Client personal information, financial data, and business records remain secure even if passwords are compromised

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Wedding businesses handle highly sensitive personal and financial information. A single compromised account could expose hundreds of couples' private data, payment information, and intimate wedding details. MFA ensures this sensitive information stays protected even with sophisticated attacks.

## ðŸŽ¯ TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

**From Technical Specification:** WS-014
- Multi-factor authentication (TOTP, SMS, Email)
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with major providers
- Advanced security features (device trust, risk assessment)
- Session management and security monitoring
- Recovery mechanisms and backup codes
- Compliance with security standards (SOC 2, GDPR)

**Technology Stack (VERIFIED):**
- Authentication: Supabase Auth with custom MFA providers
- MFA: TOTP (authenticator apps), SMS, Email verification
- SSO: OAuth 2.0/OIDC with Google, Microsoft, Okta
- Security: Device fingerprinting, risk-based authentication
- Monitoring: Security event logging and alerting

**Integration Points:**
- [WS-008 Notification Engine]: MFA code delivery and security alerts
- [WS-007 Analytics Pipeline]: Security event tracking
- [Database]: mfa_devices, security_events, device_trust
