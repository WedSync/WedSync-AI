# TEAM C - ROUND 1: WS-008 - Notification Engine - Integration & Security

**Date:** 2025-01-23  
**Feature ID:** WS-008 (Track all work with this ID)
**Priority:** P1 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Build comprehensive notification engine with multi-channel delivery, security validation, and integration middleware  
**Context:** You are Team C working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before next round.

## üéØ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding photographer managing 80+ couples
**I want to:** Automatically send timeline reminders, payment notifications, and updates via email, SMS, and push notifications
**So that:** Every couple receives timely communications without me having to remember to send individual messages

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Wedding suppliers currently use sticky notes and calendar reminders to manually send timeline confirmations, payment reminders, and updates. With 80+ couples, critical communications get missed. This notification engine automates everything while ensuring messages are delivered reliably across all channels.

## üéØ TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

**From Technical Specification:** WS-008
- Multi-channel notification delivery (email, SMS, push)
- Template management and personalization engine
- Delivery status tracking and retry mechanisms
- Notification scheduling and queue management
- Integration with journey engine and analytics
- Security validation and content sanitization

**Technology Stack (VERIFIED):**
- Backend: Next.js 15 API routes, Supabase Edge Functions
- Integrations: Email (Resend), SMS (Twilio), Push (FCM)
- Queue: Supabase Realtime, PostgreSQL job queues
- Security: Content sanitization, rate limiting, encryption
- Testing: Integration tests, notification delivery verification

**Integration Points:**
- [WS-006 Journey Engine]: Automated notification triggers
- [WS-007 Analytics Pipeline]: Delivery metrics tracking
- [WS-009 Document Generator]: Notification attachments

## üìö STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. CONTEXT7 MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
await mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("twilio");
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/twilio/twilio-node", "sms-api webhook-handling", 4000);
await mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("resend");
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/resend/resend-node", "email-templates delivery", 3000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/supabase/supabase", "edge-functions realtime", 4000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/vercel/next.js", "api-routes middleware", 3000);

// 2. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);

// 3. REVIEW existing patterns:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("Notification", "", true);
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("notification|email|sms|queue");
```
