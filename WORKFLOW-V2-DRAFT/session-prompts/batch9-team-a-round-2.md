## ðŸŽ¯ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding photographer who needs different information from each client type (engagement, wedding, anniversary)
**I want to:** Create custom forms with conditional questions, file uploads, and signature fields without technical knowledge
**So that:** I can gather exactly the right information for each service while providing a professional client experience

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Wedding photographers currently use generic contact forms that don't capture specific needs. Engagement clients need location preferences, wedding clients need timeline details, and anniversary clients need different information entirely. This form builder creates custom forms for each service type with intelligent conditional logic.
