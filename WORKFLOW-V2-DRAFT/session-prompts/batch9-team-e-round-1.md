# TEAM E - ROUND 1: WS-011 - Document Storage & Management - File System Integration

**Date:** 2025-01-23  
**Feature ID:** WS-011 (Track all work with this ID)
**Priority:** P1 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Build comprehensive document storage and management system with file organization, security, and collaboration features  
**Context:** You are Team E working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before next round.

## üéØ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding planner managing documents for 25+ couples
**I want to:** Organize contracts, photos, timelines, and vendor agreements in a secure, searchable system with version control
**So that:** I can instantly find any document, share files with clients securely, and never lose important wedding paperwork

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Wedding planners currently use a mix of Google Drive, email attachments, and physical folders to store client documents. Finding a specific contract takes 10+ minutes of searching. Documents get lost, versions get mixed up, and sharing with clients is insecure. This system creates one organized, secure location for all wedding documents.

## üéØ TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

**From Technical Specification:** WS-011
- Secure file upload with virus scanning and validation
- Intelligent file organization and categorization
- Version control and document history tracking
- Advanced search with OCR text extraction
- Secure sharing with permission management
- Integration with document generation engine

**Technology Stack (VERIFIED):**
- Storage: Supabase Storage with RLS policies
- File Processing: Sharp for images, PDF-lib for PDFs
- Search: PostgreSQL full-text search, OCR integration
- Security: File validation, virus scanning, encryption
- API: Next.js 15 API routes with streaming uploads
- Testing: File upload tests, security validation

**Integration Points:**
- [WS-009 Document Generator]: Store generated documents
- [WS-008 Notification Engine]: Document sharing notifications
- [Database]: document_storage, file_permissions, document_versions

## üìö STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. CONTEXT7 MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
await mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("supabase");
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/supabase/supabase", "storage rls-policies", 5000);
await mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("sharp");
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/lovell/sharp", "image-processing", 3000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/vercel/next.js", "file-upload streaming", 4000);
await mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("pdf-lib");
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/Hopding/pdf-lib", "pdf-processing", 3000);

// 2. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);

// 3. REVIEW existing patterns:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("Storage", "", true);
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("storage|upload|file|document");
```

2. **supabase-specialist** --think-ultra-hard "Implement secure file storage with RLS"
3. **security-compliance-officer** --think-ultra-hard "Secure file uploads and access control"
4. **api-architect** --think-hard "Design file upload API with streaming and validation"
5. **integration-specialist** --think-hard "Integrate OCR and file processing"
6. **test-automation-architect** --file-focused "Test file upload security and performance"
