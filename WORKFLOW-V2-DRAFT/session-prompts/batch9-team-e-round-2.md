## ðŸŽ¯ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Bride checking wedding details on her phone during venue visits, vendor meetings, and planning sessions
**I want to:** Access all wedding information instantly on mobile with fast loading, offline access, and app-like experience
**So that:** I can reference timelines, share vendor info, and update details anywhere without being tied to a computer

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Wedding planning happens everywhere - at venues, with vendors, during travel. Couples need instant access to their wedding information on mobile devices. Slow-loading websites and poor mobile experiences create frustration during important planning moments. This optimization creates a seamless mobile experience.
