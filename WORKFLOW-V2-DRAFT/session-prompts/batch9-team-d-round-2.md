## ðŸŽ¯ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding photographer with bookings across Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and scheduling software
**I want to:** Automatically sync all calendars, detect conflicts, and allow clients to book available time slots
**So that:** I never double-book weddings and clients can easily schedule consultations without phone tag

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Wedding professionals currently manage multiple calendars manually - personal Google Calendar, business scheduling software, and client booking systems. Double-booking disasters happen when calendars aren't synced. This integration creates one unified calendar view with automatic conflict prevention.
