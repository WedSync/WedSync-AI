# TEAM B - ROUND 2: WS-013 - Lead Scoring & Qualification - Backend Intelligence

**Date:** 2025-01-23  
**Feature ID:** WS-013 (Track all work with this ID)
**Priority:** P1 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Build intelligent lead scoring algorithm with qualification workflows and automated nurturing systems  
**Context:** You are Team B working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before next round.

## ðŸŽ¯ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding venue owner receiving 200+ inquiries per month
**I want to:** Automatically score leads by likelihood to book, budget fit, and urgency so I can prioritize follow-ups
**So that:** I can focus my limited time on the most promising leads while nurturing others automatically

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Venue owners currently respond to all inquiries equally, spending hours on leads who will never book while high-value prospects get delayed responses. This scoring system analyzes inquiry patterns, budget indicators, and timing to prioritize leads that are most likely to convert.
