Before implementing this workflow:

- [ ] Read PM-MASTER-CONTROL-V2.md completely
- [ ] Understand PROJECT-ORCHESTRATOR-GUIDE.md role
- [ ] Review FEATURE-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md process
- [ ] Check DEV-MANAGER-GUIDE.md prompt generation
- [ ] Validate SENIOR-DEV-GUIDE.md review process
- [ ] Walk through DAILY-WORKFLOW-V2.md step by step

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISKS TO CONSIDER

1. **Coordination Overhead** - More teams = more coordination needed
2. **Prompt Quality** - 75 prompts/day needs careful management
3. **Integration Complexity** - 5 teams working in parallel
4. **Review Bottleneck** - Senior Dev reviewing all code
5. **Learning Curve** - New roles need time to establish

## üí° RECOMMENDATION

1. Review all documents in this folder
2. Identify what needs adjustment for your workflow
3. Consider a gradual rollout (start with 4 teams, then 5)
4. Keep current workflow as backup
5. Run parallel for one day to compare results
