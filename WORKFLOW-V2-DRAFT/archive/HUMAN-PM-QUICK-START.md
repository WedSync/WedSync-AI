# üöÄ HUMAN PM QUICK START GUIDE
## What YOU Actually Do in the 5-Team Workflow

---

## üìå TLDR: YOUR DAILY ROUTINE

You launch sessions in this sequence:
1. **Orchestrator** - Picks today's features
2. **Feature Dev** - Creates technical specs  
3. **Dev Manager** - Generates 15 team prompts (5 teams √ó 3 rounds)
4. **Round 1:** Launch 5 teams in PARALLEL ‚Üí Wait for ALL to complete
5. **Senior Dev** - Reviews Round 1
6. **Git Ops** (if approvals) - Commits code
7. **Round 2:** Launch 5 teams again ‚Üí Wait for ALL
8. **Senior Dev** - Reviews Round 2
9. **Git Ops** (if approvals)
10. **Round 3:** Final round ‚Üí Wait for ALL
11. **Senior Dev** - Final review
12. **Final Git Ops** - Day complete

**Key Rule: All 5 teams must complete before moving to next round**

## üîÑ YOUR ACTUAL WORKFLOW (No Fixed Times)

### Step 1: Launch Orchestrator
```bash
# Open new Claude session
# Paste: PROJECT-ORCHESTRATOR-GUIDE.md
# Wait for completion
# It outputs: today's feature assignments
```

### Step 2: Launch Feature Dev
```bash
# After Orchestrator completes
# Open new Claude session  
# Paste: FEATURE-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md
# Wait for completion
# It outputs: technical specs for each feature
```

### Step 3: Launch Dev Manager
```bash
# After Feature Dev completes
# Open new Claude session
# Paste: DEV-MANAGER-GUIDE.md
# Wait for completion
# It outputs: 15 team prompts in /session-prompts/today/
```

### Step 4: ROUND 1 - Launch ALL 5 Teams Together
```bash
# Open 5 Claude sessions SIMULTANEOUSLY
# Paste into each:
Team A: team-a-round-1.md
Team B: team-b-round-1.md
Team C: team-c-round-1.md

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SYNCHRONIZATION RULES

**NEVER:**
- ‚ùå Start Round 2 while ANY Round 1 team is still working
- ‚ùå Mix rounds (Team A on Round 2 while Team B on Round 1)
- ‚ùå Skip waiting for slow teams

**ALWAYS:**
- ‚úÖ Launch all 5 teams SIMULTANEOUSLY for each round
- ‚úÖ Wait for ALL 5 to complete before ANY review
- ‚úÖ Keep all teams on the SAME round
- ‚úÖ If one team fails/crashes, fix before proceeding

**Why This Matters:**
- Teams share dependencies
- File conflicts if on different rounds
- Integration breaks if out of sync
- Testing becomes impossible

## üéØ WHAT EACH ROLE DOES FOR YOU

### Project Orchestrator
**What it does:** Reads the roadmap and picks features
**What you get:** Today's prioritized feature list
**Why it helps:** You don't need to read 380+ spec documents

### Feature Development  
**What it does:** Turns specs into technical designs
**What you get:** Detailed implementation plans
**Why it helps:** Teams know exactly what to build

### Dev Manager
**What it does:** Creates all 15 team prompts
**What you get:** Ready-to-paste prompts for each team
**Why it helps:** You don't write prompts anymore

### Dev Teams (A-E)
**What they do:** Actually build the features
**What you get:** Working code, tests, documentation
**Why it helps:** 5 teams = 3x more done daily

### Senior Dev
**What it does:** Reviews all code for quality
**What you get:** Approval/rejection verdicts
**Why it helps:** Catches issues before they break things

## üìù DOCUMENTS YOU NEED READY

Keep these 7 guides bookmarked:
1. `PROJECT-ORCHESTRATOR-GUIDE.md` - For 8 AM
2. `FEATURE-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md` - For 8:15 AM
3. `DEV-MANAGER-GUIDE.md` - For 8:45 AM
4. `SENIOR-DEV-GUIDE.md` - Backup if automated prompt fails
5. `DAILY-WORKFLOW-V2.md` - Your master timeline
6. `MIGRATION-GUIDE.md` - For transitioning
7. This guide - Your quick reference

---

## ‚ùå WHAT YOU DON'T DO ANYMORE

### Before (3-Team Model)
- ‚ùå Read specifications yourself
- ‚ùå Write technical designs
- ‚ùå Create all prompts manually
- ‚ùå Coordinate dependencies in your head
- ‚ùå Review code yourself
- ‚ùå Track everything manually

### Now (5-Team Model)
- ‚úÖ Launch pre-defined sessions
- ‚úÖ Use generated prompts
- ‚úÖ Let bots coordinate
- ‚úÖ Monitor progress
- ‚úÖ Make decisions only when blocked

---

## üö® WHEN TO INTERVENE

Only step in when:
1. **Session fails to start** - Relaunch with same prompt
2. **Blocking issue reported** - Make a decision
3. **Senior Dev finds CRITICAL issue** - Stop all work
4. **Teams report conflict** - Adjust assignments
5. **End of day** - Update status docs

Otherwise, let the system run!

---

## üí° PRO TIPS

### Morning Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
# Create today's folders
mkdir -p /session-prompts/today
mkdir -p /SESSION-LOGS/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
mkdir -p /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/orchestrator-output
mkdir -p /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/feature-development-output/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Clear yesterday's prompts
mv /session-prompts/today/* /session-prompts/archive/
```

### Parallel Launch Trick
```bash
# Open all 5 team sessions at once:
# Use browser tabs or terminal multiplexer
# Paste all 5 prompts within 1 minute
# They run simultaneously, not sequentially
```

### Quick Status Check
```bash
# At any time, run:
ls -la /SESSION-LOGS/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/

# See which teams have reported
# Check for handover files
# Monitor progress without interrupting
```

---

## üìä SUCCESS METRICS

You're doing it right when:
- ‚úÖ 15 prompts generated automatically daily
- ‚úÖ 10+ features completed per day
- ‚úÖ Senior Dev approves >80% on first review
- ‚úÖ No file conflicts between teams
- ‚úÖ You spend <3 hours actively managing

You need to adjust when:
- ‚ùå Teams waiting for dependencies
- ‚ùå Same files modified by multiple teams
- ‚ùå Senior Dev rejecting >50%
- ‚ùå Features not integrating
- ‚ùå You're coding instead of orchestrating

---

## üÜò EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### If Orchestrator Fails
```bash
# Use yesterday's feature list
# Or manually pick 10 features from CORE-SPECIFICATIONS
```

### If Dev Manager Fails
```bash
# Use TEAM-PROMPT-TEMPLATES.md
# Manually create 15 prompts (takes 30 min)
```

### If Senior Dev Misses Issues
```bash
# Run your own spot checks:
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test
```

### If Everything Breaks
```bash
# Revert to 3-team model immediately
# Use backup workflow docs
# No progress lost
```

---

## üîÄ GIT OPERATIONS - WHEN TO LAUNCH?

**Quick Decision Guide:**

After each Senior Dev review, check their report for "APPROVED FOR MERGE":
- ‚úÖ Has approvals ‚Üí Launch Git Operations (10 min session)
- ‚ùå No approvals ‚Üí Skip Git Operations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only "NEEDS FIXES" ‚Üí Skip Git Operations

**The Git Operations role is:**
- NOT a persistent service
- NOT always running
- ONLY launched when needed
- Closes after ~10 minutes

**Example flow:**
```
11:30 AM: Senior Dev reviews Sprint 1
11:55 AM: You read report - sees 3 features approved
12:00 PM: Launch Git Operations ‚Üí commits created ‚Üí session ends
12:10 PM: Git session closed, commits ready
```

## üéØ REMEMBER

**You are the conductor, not the orchestra.**

Let the automated roles do their jobs. Your value is in:
- Starting the right processes
- Making strategic decisions
- Removing blockers
- Maintaining velocity

The system is designed to run itself once started.
