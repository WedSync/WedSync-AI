## üöÄ MIGRATION PHASES

### Phase 1: Preparation (Day 0)
**DO NOT STOP CURRENT WORK**

#### Morning (30 minutes)
1. **Review all draft documents:**
   ```bash
   /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/README.md
   /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/PM-MASTER-CONTROL-V2.md
   /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/PROJECT-ORCHESTRATOR-GUIDE.md
   /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/FEATURE-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md
   /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/DEV-MANAGER-GUIDE.md
   /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SENIOR-DEV-GUIDE.md
   /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/DAILY-WORKFLOW-V2.md
   /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/TEAM-PROMPT-TEMPLATES.md
   ```

2. **Test new roles in isolation:**
   - Run Project Orchestrator session (15 min)
   - Run Feature Development session (30 min)
   - Run Dev Manager session (15 min)
   - Verify outputs are correct

3. **Prepare folder structure:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/orchestrator-output
   mkdir -p /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/feature-development-output/[DATE]
   mkdir -p /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/dev-manager-output
   ```

#### Afternoon
- Continue with current 3-team model
- No disruption to ongoing work

---

### Phase 2: Parallel Testing (Day 1)

#### Morning
1. **Run BOTH workflows in parallel:**
   - 3 teams continue current work (production)
   - 2 new teams test new workflow (non-production)

2. **Test team allocation:**
   ```
   Production (3 teams): Critical features
   Test (2 teams): Non-critical features using new workflow
   ```

3. **Measure results:**
   - Compare velocity
   - Check integration success
   - Validate quality gates

#### Afternoon Review
- Assess test results
- Fix any workflow issues
- Decide on full migration timing

---

### Phase 3: Gradual Transition (Day 2-3)

#### Day 2 Morning
1. **Move to 4 teams:**
   ```
   Team A: Frontend (new specialization)
   Team B: Backend (new specialization)
   Team C: Current mixed model
   Team D: Testing (partial new model)
   ```

2. **Introduce orchestration layer:**
   - Run Orchestrator session
   - Run Feature Dev session
   - Generate prompts for 4 teams

#### Day 2 Afternoon
- Monitor performance
- Adjust team boundaries
- Fix coordination issues

#### Day 3
1. **Full 5-team model:**
   - All teams specialized
   - Full orchestration pipeline
   - Complete new workflow

---

## üìÅ FILE STRUCTURE MIGRATION

### Step 1: Backup Current Structure
```bash
# Create backup
cp -r /session-prompts /session-prompts-backup-[DATE]
cp PM-MASTER-CONTROL.md PM-MASTER-CONTROL-v1-backup.md
cp WORKFLOW-V2-BULLETPROOF.md WORKFLOW-V2-BULLETPROOF-backup.md
```

### Step 2: Create New Directories
```bash
# New orchestration directories
mkdir -p /orchestrator-output
mkdir -p /feature-development-output
mkdir -p /dev-manager-output

# Expanded session structure
mkdir -p /session-prompts/today
mkdir -p /session-prompts/archive
```

### Step 3: Update Status Files
```bash
# Update these files to track 5 teams:
- PROJECT-STATUS.md (add Team D & E sections)
- FEATURE-COMPLETION-TRACKER.md (track by team)
```

---

## üë• ROLE TRANSITION GUIDE

### For Human PM

#### Old Role (3-Team Model)
```
1. Read specifications
2. Create 3 prompts directly
3. Launch 3 teams
4. Review results
```

#### New Role (5-Team Model)
```
1. Launch Orchestrator (15 min)
2. Launch Feature Dev (30 min)
3. Launch Dev Manager (15 min)
4. Launch 5 teams (parallel)
5. Launch Senior Dev reviews (3x daily)
```

**Time investment changes:**
- Old: ~4 hours active management
- New: ~2.5 hours orchestration + monitoring

### New Session Sequence

#### 8:00 AM - Start Orchestration
```bash
# Session 1: Project Orchestrator
claude-code "You are the Project Orchestrator. Here is your guide:"
# Paste: PROJECT-ORCHESTRATOR-GUIDE.md
# Wait 15 minutes
```

#### 8:15 AM - Feature Development
```bash
# Session 2: Feature Development
claude-code "You are Feature Development. Here is your guide:"
# Paste: FEATURE-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md
# Wait 30 minutes
```

#### 8:45 AM - Dev Manager
```bash
# Session 3: Dev Manager
claude-code "You are the Dev Manager. Here is your guide:"
# Paste: DEV-MANAGER-GUIDE.md
# Wait 15 minutes
```

#### 9:00 AM - Launch Teams
```bash
# Launch 5 parallel sessions
claude-code "Team A Sprint 1" < team-a-sprint-1.md &
claude-code "Team B Sprint 1" < team-b-sprint-1.md &
claude-code "Team C Sprint 1" < team-c-sprint-1.md &
claude-code "Team D Sprint 1" < team-d-sprint-1.md &
claude-code "Team E Sprint 1" < team-e-sprint-1.md &
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ROLLBACK PLAN

If the new workflow fails, immediately:

### 1. Stop All 5-Team Sessions
```bash
# Kill all active sessions
# Return to 3-team model immediately
```

### 2. Restore Previous Workflow
```bash
# Restore from backup
cp PM-MASTER-CONTROL-v1-backup.md PM-MASTER-CONTROL.md
cp -r /session-prompts-backup-[DATE]/* /session-prompts/
```

### 3. Resume 3-Team Model
- Use original prompts
- Continue with known workflow
- No loss of progress

### 4. Analyze Failure
- What broke?
- Which role failed?
- Was it coordination or execution?

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Problem: Orchestrator can't find features
**Solution:** Check CORE-SPECIFICATIONS paths, ensure README is current

### Problem: Teams have file conflicts
**Solution:** Dev Manager must better separate work, use Team C for shared files

### Problem: Dependencies not ready
**Solution:** Adjust sprint timing, use mocks, reorder features

### Problem: Senior Dev overwhelmed
**Solution:** Stagger review times, focus on critical paths only

### Problem: Context limits hit
**Solution:** Ensure guides are self-contained, reduce spec verbosity

---

## üí° TIPS FOR SMOOTH MIGRATION

1. **Start on Monday** - Full week to stabilize
2. **Run partial day first** - Test morning only
3. **Keep old workflow ready** - Can switch back instantly
4. **Document everything** - Track what works/fails
5. **Communicate clearly** - Everyone knows the plan

---

## üìà EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Week 1 (Migration)
- Day 1-3: Migration and stabilization
- Day 4-5: Full velocity testing
- Expected: 5-8 features/day initially

### Week 2 (Optimization)
- Refine coordination
- Optimize team boundaries
- Expected: 10-12 features/day

### Week 3 (Full Speed)
- All issues resolved
- Peak efficiency reached
- Expected: 15+ features/day

### Month 1 Results
- ~300 features completed (vs ~100 with 3 teams)
- Project at 45-50% completion
- Clear path to MVP

---

## üö¶ GO/NO-GO DECISION POINTS

### Day 1 - End of Day
**GO if:**
- At least 5 features completed
- No critical failures
- Teams coordinating

**NO-GO if:**
- Total chaos
- <3 features done
- Multiple blockers

### Day 3 - End of Day
**COMMIT if:**
- 10+ features/day achieved

---

## üìû EMERGENCY CONTACTS

If migration fails catastrophically:

1. **Immediate:** Rollback to 3-team model
2. **Review:** What went wrong
3. **Adjust:** Fix issues in draft
4. **Retry:** Attempt again in 1 week
