## 🎯 WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN RIGHT NOW

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Fix Team Reporting
```
1. 🔧 Fix paths in team prompts (Teams B, C, D, E)
2. 📁 Ensure /SESSION-LOGS/today/ directory exists
3. 🔄 Re-run Teams B, C, D, E for Round 1
4. ✅ Verify all 15 Round 1 reports exist
5. 👨‍💻 Senior Dev can then review Round 1
```

## 📂 SEQUENTIAL FILE NAMING CONVENTION

### Current Problematic Structure:
```
❌ Files scattered across multiple directories
❌ Inconsistent naming (batch-N vs DATE)
❌ Hard to see completion status
```

### RECOMMENDED SEQUENTIAL STRUCTURE:
```

## 🔧 RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE FIXES

1. **Create Status Tracking Files:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/00-STATUS
   echo "STEP 4: Teams Round 1 (BLOCKED)" > current-step.txt
   echo "Fix team prompt paths, re-run Teams B,C,D,E" > next-action.txt
   ```

2. **Fix Team Paths:**
   ```bash
   # Update all team prompts with correct absolute paths
   sed -i 's|/SESSION-LOGS/[^/]*|/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SESSION-LOGS/today|g' \
     /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/session-prompts/active/team-*.md
   ```

3. **Create Helper Scripts:**
   - `where-am-i.sh` - Shows current step
   - `show-progress.sh` - Visual progress bar
   - `next-action.sh` - What to do next

---

**BOTTOM LINE:** You're actually at 30% complete, stuck on Teams Round 1 due to path issues. Not on Round 3 as believed.
