## 📚 STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. LOAD UI STYLE GUIDE (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK):
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. CONTEXT7 MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
await mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("chart.js");
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/chartjs/chart.js", "data-visualization", 5000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/supabase/supabase", "aggregation-queries", 3000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/vercel/next.js", "server-components", 2000);

// Analytics libraries:
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/date-fns/date-fns", "date-analytics", 2000);

// 3. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// 4. REVIEW existing response patterns:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("response", "src/app", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/components/forms");
```

## 🚀 STEP 2: LAUNCH PARALLEL AGENTS (AFTER documentation loaded!)

**NOW that you have current docs, launch agents with specific knowledge:**

1. **task-tracker-coordinator** --think-hard --with-context7-docs "Response management completion"
2. **data-analytics-engineer** --think-hard --use-loaded-docs "Response analytics and visualization"
3. **integration-specialist** --think-ultra-hard --follow-existing-patterns "Data pipeline completion" 
4. **security-compliance-officer** --think-ultra-hard --check-current-best-practices
5. **test-automation-architect** --tdd-approach --use-testing-patterns-from-docs
6. **playwright-visual-testing-specialist** --accessibility-first --multi-tab
7. **performance-optimization-expert** --data-aggregation --query-optimization

**AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** "Use the Context7 docs loaded in Step 1. Complete response management."
