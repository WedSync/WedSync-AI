## 📚 STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. LOAD UI STYLE GUIDE (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK):
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. CONTEXT7 MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
await mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("playwright");
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/microsoft/playwright", "e2e-testing", 5000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/vercel/next.js", "production-deployment", 3000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/supabase/supabase", "production-checklist", 2000);

// Integration testing libraries:
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/vitest-dev/vitest", "integration-tests", 2000);

// 3. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// 4. REVIEW all team outputs:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("*", "src/app", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/components");
```

## 🚀 STEP 2: LAUNCH PARALLEL AGENTS (AFTER documentation loaded!)

**NOW that you have current docs, launch agents with specific knowledge:**

1. **task-tracker-coordinator** --think-hard --with-context7-docs "Final integration testing"
2. **test-automation-architect** --think-hard --use-loaded-docs "Comprehensive E2E testing"
3. **performance-optimization-expert** --think-ultra-hard --follow-existing-patterns "Load testing and optimization" 
4. **security-compliance-officer** --think-ultra-hard --check-current-best-practices
5. **playwright-visual-testing-specialist** --accessibility-first --multi-tab
6. **deployment-safety-checker** --production-readiness --final-validation
7. **verification-cycle-coordinator** --multi-pass-validation --comprehensive-checks

**AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** "Use the Context7 docs loaded in Step 1. Validate all team integrations."
