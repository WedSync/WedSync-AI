# TEAM C - ROUND 2: CSV/Excel Import Enhancement - Advanced Import Processing & Validation

**Date:** 2025-08-20  
**Priority:** P1 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Enhance existing CSV/Excel import system with advanced validation, mapping, and error handling  
**Context:** You are Team C working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before next round.

---

## üéØ TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

**From Feature Assignment:**
- **Current Status:** 40% complete from master-queue.json
- **Enhancement Focus:** Advanced data validation, field mapping, duplicate detection
- Add support for multiple file formats (.csv, .xlsx, .xls)
- Implement intelligent column mapping with suggestions
- Build comprehensive error reporting and data preview
- Add batch processing for large import files

**Technology Stack (VERIFIED):**
- Frontend: Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL 15), Edge Functions
- Testing: Playwright MCP, Vitest
- File Processing: xlsx, papaparse libraries

**Integration Points:**
- **Client Management**: Integration with existing client data tables
- **File Storage**: Supabase storage for temporary import files
- **Validation**: Enhanced data validation and cleansing

---

## üìö STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. LOAD UI STYLE GUIDE (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK):
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. CONTEXT7 MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
await mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("xlsx");
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/supabase/supabase", "storage-upload", 5000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/vercel/next.js", "file-uploads", 3000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/papaparse/papaparse", "csv-parsing", 2000);

// File processing libraries:
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/supabase/supabase", "edge-functions", 2000);

// 3. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// 4. REVIEW existing import code:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("import", "src/app", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/components/clients");
```

---

## üöÄ STEP 2: LAUNCH PARALLEL AGENTS (AFTER documentation loaded!)

**NOW that you have current docs, launch agents with specific knowledge:**

1. **task-tracker-coordinator** --think-hard --with-context7-docs "Import enhancement"
2. **integration-specialist** --think-hard --use-loaded-docs "File processing and validation"
3. **data-analytics-engineer** --think-ultra-hard --follow-existing-patterns "Data mapping and cleansing" 
4. **security-compliance-officer** --think-ultra-hard --check-current-best-practices
5. **test-automation-architect** --tdd-approach --use-testing-patterns-from-docs
6. **playwright-visual-testing-specialist** --accessibility-first --multi-tab
7. **performance-optimization-expert** --file-processing --memory-management

**AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** "Use the Context7 docs loaded in Step 1. Enhance existing import system."

## üé≠ REVOLUTIONARY PLAYWRIGHT MCP TESTING (MANDATORY)

```javascript
// 1. FILE UPLOAD AND PROCESSING TESTING
await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/clients/import"});
await mcp__playwright__browser_file_upload({
  paths: ["/path/to/test-clients.xlsx"]
});
await mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for({text: "Processing file"});
await mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot();

// 2. COLUMN MAPPING INTERFACE TESTING
