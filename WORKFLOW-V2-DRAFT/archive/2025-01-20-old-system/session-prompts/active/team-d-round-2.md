## üìö STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. LOAD UI STYLE GUIDE (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK):
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. CONTEXT7 MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
await mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("supabase");
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/supabase/supabase", "storage-upload", 5000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/vercel/next.js", "image-optimization", 3000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/supabase/supabase", "row-level-security", 2000);

// Photo management libraries:
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/lovell/sharp", "image-processing", 2000);

// 3. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// 4. REVIEW existing patterns:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("upload", "src/lib", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/components/clients");
```

---

## üöÄ STEP 2: LAUNCH PARALLEL AGENTS (AFTER documentation loaded!)

**NOW that you have current docs, launch agents with specific knowledge:**

1. **task-tracker-coordinator** --think-hard --with-context7-docs "Photo management system"
2. **supabase-specialist** --think-hard --use-loaded-docs "File storage and RLS"
3. **react-ui-specialist** --think-ultra-hard --follow-existing-patterns "Gallery and upload UI" 
4. **security-compliance-officer** --think-ultra-hard --check-current-best-practices
5. **test-automation-architect** --tdd-approach --use-testing-patterns-from-docs
6. **playwright-visual-testing-specialist** --accessibility-first --multi-tab
7. **performance-optimization-expert** --image-optimization --lazy-loading

**AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** "Use the Context7 docs loaded in Step 1. Focus on secure photo handling."

## üéØ SPECIFIC DELIVERABLES FOR ROUND 2

### Core Photo Management:
- [ ] Secure photo upload component with drag-and-drop
- [ ] Photo album organization system with client linking
- [ ] Client gallery viewer with permission controls
- [ ] Photo metadata management (EXIF, tags, descriptions)
- [ ] Image processing pipeline (resize, optimize, watermark)
- [ ] Photo sharing and download controls
- [ ] Bulk photo operations (select, move, delete)
- [ ] Advanced Playwright tests for file upload workflows

---

## üîó DEPENDENCIES

### What you NEED from other teams:
- FROM Team C: Client data structure - Required for photo-client linking
- FROM Team B: File upload security patterns - Needed for secure photo handling

### What other teams NEED from you:
- TO Team E: Photo component patterns - They need this for onboarding galleries
- TO Team A: Photo gallery UI patterns - Blocking their portfolio features

---

## üîí SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- [ ] Only image files accepted (.jpg, .png, .webp, .heic)
- [ ] File size limits enforced (max 50MB per photo)
- [ ] RLS policies prevent cross-client photo access
- [ ] Malicious file scanning before storage
- [ ] Watermarking applied to protect photographer IP
- [ ] Audit logging for photo access and downloads
- [ ] GDPR compliance for photo metadata and facial recognition

---

## üé≠ REVOLUTIONARY PLAYWRIGHT MCP TESTING (MANDATORY)

```javascript
// 1. PHOTO UPLOAD TESTING
await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/clients/123/photos"});
await mcp__playwright__browser_file_upload({
  paths: [
    "/path/to/wedding-photo-1.jpg",
    "/path/to/wedding-photo-2.png",
    "/path/to/wedding-photo-3.heic"
  ]
});
await mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for({text: "Uploading 3 photos"});
await mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot();

// 2. PHOTO GALLERY TESTING
await mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for({text: "3 photos uploaded"});
await mcp__playwright__browser_click({
  element: "Gallery view button",
  ref: "button[data-testid='gallery-view']"
});
await mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot();

// 3. PHOTO ORGANIZATION TESTING
await mcp__playwright__browser_click({
  element: "Create album button",
  ref: "button[data-testid='create-album']"
});
await mcp__playwright__browser_type({
  element: "Album name input",
  ref: "input[data-testid='album-name']",
  text: "Ceremony Photos"
});
await mcp__playwright__browser_drag({

await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({url: "/clients/123/gallery?share_token=abc123"});
await mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for({text: "Wedding Gallery"});
