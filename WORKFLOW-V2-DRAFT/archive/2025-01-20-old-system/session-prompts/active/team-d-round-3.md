## üéØ TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

**From Feature Assignment:**
- **Source:** /CORE-SPECIFICATIONS/02-WEDSYNC-SUPPLIER-PLATFORM/04-Forms-System/03-field-types/05-payment-fields md.md
- Create payment form fields with Stripe integration
- Build invoice generation and payment processing
- Implement payment status tracking and notifications
- Add payment plan and installment options
- Integration with existing form system and Team B's templates

**Technology Stack (VERIFIED):**
- Frontend: Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL 15), Edge Functions

## üìö STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. LOAD UI STYLE GUIDE (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK):
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. CONTEXT7 MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
await mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("stripe");
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/stripe/stripe-js", "payment-intents", 5000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/stripe/stripe-node", "webhooks", 3000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/vercel/next.js", "api-routes", 2000);

// Payment processing libraries:
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/supabase/supabase", "webhook-handling", 2000);

// 3. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// 4. REVIEW existing payment patterns:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("payment", "src/lib", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/components/forms");
```

---

## üöÄ STEP 2: LAUNCH PARALLEL AGENTS (AFTER documentation loaded!)

**NOW that you have current docs, launch agents with specific knowledge:**

1. **task-tracker-coordinator** --think-hard --with-context7-docs "Payment fields implementation"
2. **integration-specialist** --think-hard --use-loaded-docs "Stripe payment integration"
3. **security-compliance-officer** --think-ultra-hard --follow-existing-patterns "PCI DSS compliance" 
4. **api-architect** --think-ultra-hard --check-current-best-practices
5. **test-automation-architect** --tdd-approach --use-testing-patterns-from-docs
6. **playwright-visual-testing-specialist** --accessibility-first --multi-tab
7. **code-quality-guardian** --check-patterns --match-codebase-style

**AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** "Use the Context7 docs loaded in Step 1. Implement secure payment processing."
