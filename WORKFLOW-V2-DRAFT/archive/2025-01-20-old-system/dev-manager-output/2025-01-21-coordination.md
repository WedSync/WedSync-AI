- Round 3: Toast Notifications System (user feedback integration)

## CRITICAL INTEGRATION POINTS

### End of Round 1:
- Team B provides Journey Execution Engine → Team C needs for service connections
- Team A provides auth form patterns → All teams can reuse
- Team E provides lead tracking foundation → Team E Round 2 builds on this
- Team D provides database optimization → Team B scheduler benefits

### End of Round 2:
- Team B provides rate limiting → Team A payment UI integrates
- Team A provides payment UI → Other teams can reference for billing
- Team E provides quote system → Integrates with Round 1 lead tracking
- Team C provides monitoring → All teams benefit from observability

### End of Round 3:
- Team A provides complete loading framework → All teams integration
- Team B provides complete security hardening → Production ready
- Team C validates all integrations → Final system validation
- Team D ensures database performance → Production ready
- Team E provides complete client management flow → Business ready

## POTENTIAL CONFLICTS & RESOLUTIONS

### File-Level Conflicts (AVOIDED):
- **No file overlaps**: Each team has distinct file ownership
- **Team A**: `/src/components/auth/`, `/src/components/billing/`, `/src/components/ui/loading/`
- **Team B**: `/src/lib/journey/`, `/src/app/api/journeys/`, `/src/lib/security/`
- **Team C**: `/src/lib/services/`, `/src/lib/monitoring/`, `/tests/integration/`
- **Team D**: `/supabase/migrations/`, database-specific files
- **Team E**: `/src/app/(dashboard)/clients/`, lead/quote specific files

### Integration Conflicts (MANAGED):
- **Journey execution dependency**: Team C waits for Team B Round 1 completion
- **Payment integration**: Team A Round 2 needs Team B rate limiting patterns
- **Database performance**: Team B scheduler benefits from Team D Round 1
- **Monitoring integration**: Team C Round 2 provides infrastructure for all

## BLOCKING DEPENDENCIES

### Round 1 Dependencies:
- Team C blocked until Team B completes Journey Execution Engine
- Mitigation: Team C starts with email templates and service architecture

### Round 2 Dependencies:
- Team A payment UI benefits from Team B rate limiting patterns
- Team E quote system builds on Round 1 lead tracking
- Team D analytics tables integrate with Team B execution metrics

### Round 3 Dependencies:
- Team C integration testing requires all other teams' Round 2 completion
- Team A loading states integrate with all previous Team A work
- Team E notifications integrate with lead tracking and quotes

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Technical Completion:
- All 15 prompts executed successfully
- Zero file conflicts between teams
- All integration points working
- Performance targets met (<2s API responses, <1s page loads)

### Integration Success:
- Journey Builder fully functional (Team B + Team C)
- Authentication flow complete (Team A + Team B security)
- Client management complete (Team E full flow)
- Database performance optimized (Team D)
- System observability active (Team C monitoring)

### Business Impact:
- Journey Builder execution from 75% to 100%
- Complete authentication and security system
- Full client lifecycle management
- Payment processing ready
- Performance monitoring active

## ESCALATION PATH

### If Teams Fall Behind:
1. **Round 1**: Focus on critical path (Journey Builder execution)
2. **Round 2**: Reallocate resources to security (rate limiting, CSRF)
3. **Round 3**: Prioritize integration testing over polish

### If Integration Issues:
1. **Team C coordination**: Primary integration team resolves conflicts
2. **Pair programming**: Teams work together on integration points
3. **Simplified scope**: Reduce feature scope to ensure integration

## DAILY COORDINATION PROTOCOL

### Before Each Round:
- All teams confirm previous round completion
- Dependency handoffs verified
- Integration points tested
- Next round dependencies confirmed

### During Each Round:
- Hourly check-ins on critical path items
- Real-time dependency resolution
- Integration conflict prevention
- Performance monitoring

### After Each Round:
- All deliverables verified
- Integration testing completed
- Dependencies provided to dependent teams
- Next round preparation

---

**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR**: All teams must complete their assigned round before ANY team starts the next round. This ensures proper integration and prevents conflicts.

**COORDINATION LEAD**: Team C handles all integration conflicts and cross-team coordination issues.

**ESCALATION**: Any blocking issues immediately escalate to Senior Dev for resolution.
