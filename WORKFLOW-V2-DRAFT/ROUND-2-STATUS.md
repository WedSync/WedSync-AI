### Key Finding from Round 1 Review
Senior Dev found critical issues:
- Team A: Hallucinated implementation (files don't exist)
- Team B: No delivery at all
- Team D: Only design, no implementation
- Team E: Syntax errors preventing compilation
- Team C: Only team with working code (approved with minor issues)

Round 2 should address these critical issues.
