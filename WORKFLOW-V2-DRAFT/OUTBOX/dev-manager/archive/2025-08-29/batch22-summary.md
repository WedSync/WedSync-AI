## KEY DEPENDENCIES & HANDOFFS

### Critical Path Items:
1. **Team B must complete MFA backend (WS-174)** before Team A can test UI
2. **Team C must setup CDN (WS-173)** before performance can be validated
3. **Team B must implement encryption (WS-175)** before Team E can test compliance

### Round-to-Round Dependencies:
- Round 1 → Round 2: Core features must be working
- Round 2 → Round 3: Integration points must be connected
- Round 3 → Completion: All tests must pass

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### High Priority Risks:
1. **Performance degradation from encryption** - Mitigate with careful algorithm selection
2. **MFA breaking existing flows** - Mitigate with feature flags
3. **Bundle size exceeding mobile limits** - Mitigate with aggressive splitting

### Medium Priority Risks:
1. **OAuth provider downtime** - Mitigate with fallback auth methods
2. **Key rotation complexity** - Mitigate with automation
3. **Mobile battery drain** - Mitigate with performance monitoring
