## üéØ REVISED TEAM RANKINGS

### ü•á **TEAM D (WS-055) - EXCEPTIONAL PERFORMANCE**
**Score: 9.5/10** *(Increased from 9.2)*

#### Implementation Statistics:
- **Core ML Engine:** 540 lines (booking-predictor.ts)
- **Intent Scoring:** 370+ lines (intent-scorer.ts)
- **Real-Time Processing:** 450+ lines (real-time-scoring.ts)

1. Comprehensive code search strategies
2. Multiple verification approaches
3. Avoiding premature conclusions

All teams should be commended for their excellent work in Batch 4, Round 1.
