## SECURITY VALIDATION GATES

### After Each Round:
1. Security compliance check (Team D)
2. Performance benchmarks (< 10ms encryption)
3. GDPR compliance validation
4. Audit trail verification
5. Vulnerability assessment

### Before Production:
- [ ] All encryption tests passing
- [ ] GDPR Article 32 compliance verified
- [ ] Audit logging comprehensive
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance targets met

---

## RISK MITIGATION

### Identified Risks:
1. **Performance Impact:** Encryption overhead
   - Mitigation: Parallel processing, caching
   
2. **Key Management Complexity:** Rotation without downtime
   - Mitigation: Dual-key system, gradual rollover

3. **GDPR Deadline:** Legal compliance required
   - Mitigation: Priority focus, legal review

4. **Audit Volume:** Storage scaling concerns
   - Mitigation: Retention policies, compression

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Technical Metrics:
- Encryption overhead < 10ms
