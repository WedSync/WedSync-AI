# FEATURE REJECTED: WS-064 - Meeting Scheduler

**Reason**: This feature involves new client booking and inquiry capture which is outside WedSync scope

**Original Request**: Public booking page for couples to schedule consultations, venue tours, and planning meetings for NEW client acquisition

**Analysis**: 
- Creates "public booking page where couples can self-schedule consultations"
- Designed for NEW client acquisition rather than existing client coordination
- Includes payment processing for consultations
- This is lead generation/sales tooling, not wedding coordination

**WedSync Scope**: Wedding day coordination for EXISTING clients only

**Alternative**: Meeting scheduler for existing clients to coordinate their wedding plans would be acceptable

**Date Rejected**: 2025-01-24
**Rejected By**: Dev Manager (following validation rules)

**VALIDATION RULES TRIGGERED:**
- ❌ Is this about getting NEW wedding clients? → YES (venue tours, consultations)  
- ❌ Is this feature about sales to wedding clients? → YES (paid consultations)
- ❌ Is this booking for NEW client acquisition? → YES

This feature is fundamentally about sales and lead conversion, not wedding coordination.
