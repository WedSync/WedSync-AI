## 🔄 EXECUTION STRATEGY

### **Phase 1 (NOW - Hours 0-16)**
Teams execute available Round 1 prompts in parallel:
- No blocking dependencies between teams
- Focus on core feature implementation
- Build foundational components

### **Phase 2 (Hours 17-32)**  
Round 2 enhancement and integration:
- Teams integrate Round 1 outputs
- Enhanced features and polish
- Cross-team API contracts solidified

### **Phase 3 (Hours 33-48)**
Final integration and production readiness:
- Complete system integration
- Performance optimization
- Security validation and compliance certification

---

## 📊 RISK ASSESSMENT

### **LOW RISK ✅**
- Teams can start immediately with available prompts
- No critical blocking dependencies identified
- Security frameworks well-defined

### **MEDIUM RISK ⚠️**  
- Performance impact of encryption needs monitoring
- GDPR deadline pressure for legal compliance
- Large volume of audit logs may impact storage

### **MITIGATION STRATEGIES**
