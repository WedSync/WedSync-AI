# BATCH 28 COORDINATION DOCUMENT

**Date:** 2025-01-20
**Batch:** 28
**Features:** WS-194, WS-195, WS-196
**Teams:** A, B, C, D, E

## ROUND SCHEDULE
- **Round 1:** All teams work in parallel - complete before Round 2
- **Round 2:** All teams work in parallel - complete before Round 3  
- **Round 3:** All teams work in parallel - final integration

## FEATURE ALLOCATION STRATEGY

### WS-194 - Environment Management
**Business Context:** DevOps teams need secure environment validation during peak wedding season deployments

**Team Assignments:**
- **Team A:** Environment dashboard frontend with validation status displays
- **Team B:** Backend validation engine with secret rotation and configuration checks
- **Team C:** Vercel deployment integration and automated environment setup
- **Team D:** Admin configuration interfaces and environment switching UI
- **Team E:** Testing framework for environment validation and deployment verification

### WS-195 - Business Metrics Dashboard  
**Business Context:** Executive teams tracking MRR, churn, and viral growth during wedding season spikes

**Team Assignments:**
- **Team A:** MRR calculation engine with detailed movement tracking and financial analytics
- **Team B:** Executive dashboard frontend with real-time metrics and business intelligence charts
- **Team C:** Data pipeline integration connecting subscription, user, and financial systems
- **Team D:** Metrics visualization components and interactive business health displays
- **Team E:** Performance testing for metrics calculations and dashboard load handling

### WS-196 - API Routes Structure
**Business Context:** Standardized API patterns for supplier/couple integrations and third-party connections

**Team Assignments:**
- **Team A:** Backend API route handlers with comprehensive validation and wedding industry context
- **Team B:** API infrastructure setup including logging, rate limiting, and monitoring
- **Team C:** API documentation system and developer integration guides
- **Team D:** Developer tools including API explorer and testing interfaces
- **Team E:** End-to-end testing of API endpoints with authentication and business context validation

## INTEGRATION POINTS

### End of Round 1:
- **Team A → Team D:** Environment validation results for dashboard display
- **Team A → Team B:** MRR calculation data structures for frontend visualization  
- **Team A → Team C:** API route patterns for documentation generation

### End of Round 2:
- **Team B → Team C:** Environment config data for Vercel integration
- **Team B → Team D:** Metrics dashboard components for admin interfaces
- **Team C → Team D:** API documentation for developer tools integration

### End of Round 3:
- **All teams:** Complete integration testing across environment management, business metrics, and API systems
- **Team E:** Comprehensive testing validation of all three feature systems working together

## POTENTIAL CONFLICTS & RESOLUTIONS

### File Overlap Prevention:
- **Environment Config:** Team B handles `/lib/env.ts`, Team C handles `/scripts/setup-vercel-env.sh`
- **Metrics Database:** Team A handles `/lib/metrics/`, Team B handles `/components/admin/metrics/`
- **API Structure:** Team A handles route handlers, Team B handles infrastructure, Team C handles documentation

### Database Migration Coordination:
- **WS-194:** Environment and secret rotation tables (Team B creates, SQL Expert applies)
- **WS-195:** Business metrics and MRR tracking tables (Team A creates, SQL Expert applies) 
- **WS-196:** API logging and route configuration tables (Team A creates, SQL Expert applies)

### Dependency Management:
- **Team C** waits for Team B environment config structure before Vercel integration
- **Team D** waits for Team B metrics calculation before dashboard visualization
- **Team E** waits for Teams A-D completion before comprehensive testing

## BLOCKING DEPENDENCIES

### Critical Path Analysis:
1. **Environment validation backend** (Team B) → **Vercel integration** (Team C)
2. **MRR calculation engine** (Team A) → **Business dashboard** (Team B) 
3. **API route structure** (Team A) → **API documentation** (Team C) → **Developer tools** (Team D)

### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Teams use mock data** during Round 1 for parallel development
- **Interface contracts defined** in Round 1 for seamless Round 2 integration
- **Team E creates test scaffolding** while waiting for feature completion

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Round 1 Targets:
- Environment validation prevents invalid deployments  
- MRR calculations accurately track subscription movements
- API routes follow standardized patterns with proper validation

### Round 2 Targets:
- Environment dashboard shows real-time config status
- Business metrics dashboard displays executive KPIs
- API documentation covers all endpoint patterns

### Round 3 Targets:
- Complete integration across all environment, metrics, and API systems
- Performance targets met: <2min environment validation, <200ms API responses
- Zero security vulnerabilities in environment config and API endpoints

## TIMELINE EXPECTATIONS

- **Round 1:** 3-4 days (core implementations)
- **Round 2:** 2-3 days (integration and enhancement)  
- **Round 3:** 1-2 days (final testing and validation)

**Total Batch Duration:** 6-9 days
