# FEATURE REJECTED: WS-025 - Meeting Scheduler

**Reason**: This feature involves new client acquisition and lead generation which is outside WedSync scope

**Original Request**: Public booking page for couples to schedule consultations, venue tours, and planning meetings with suppliers

**Forbidden Elements Detected**:
- Lines 4-7: "couples can self-schedule consultations" - This is for acquiring NEW clients
- Line 7: "Her booking rate increases 40%" - Focus on business development/sales
- Lines 21-22: `price_cents` and `currency` for charging consultation fees to prospects  
- Lines 320-322: Payment processing for consultation bookings
- Public booking system designed for lead generation and new client acquisition

**Alternative**: Create meeting scheduler focused purely on existing client coordination:
- Meeting scheduling between suppliers and EXISTING clients about their wedding planning
- Coordination meetings between multiple vendors for specific weddings
- Client check-in meetings for wedding milestone discussions
- Vendor collaboration sessions for wedding day coordination

**Status**: REJECTED - Designed for new client acquisition rather than wedding coordination
