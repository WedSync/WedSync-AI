# FEATURE REJECTED: WS-169 - Marketing Automation Engine

**Reason**: This feature involves lead nurturing and marketing automation to help suppliers acquire new wedding clients, which is outside WedSync scope

**Original Request**: Marketing automation engine to "nurture leads and engage clients", "encouraging referrals", and "increases referral bookings by 30%"

**Specific Violations**:
- ❌ Lead nurturing ("nurture leads") - Forbidden per instructions
- ❌ Marketing automation for new business ("encouraging referrals")  
- ❌ Features to acquire NEW wedding customers ("increases referral bookings")

**Alternative**: Consider instead a system for:
- Wedding day coordination communication between existing vendors
- Timeline update notifications for active wedding planning
- Vendor sync messaging for wedding logistics (NOT sales/marketing)

**Date Rejected**: 2025-08-25
**Rejected By**: Dev Manager (Batch 20 Processing)
