## üìã MISSING FEATURES TO INVESTIGATE

### CRITICAL PDF/DOCUMENT PROCESSING (WS-121, WS-122)

#### WS-121: PDF Analysis System
- **Business Impact:** Automated document processing
- **Expected Location:** `/src/lib/pdf/`, `/src/app/api/pdf-analysis/`
- **Dependencies:** PDF parsing libraries (pdf-parse, pdfjs)
- **Database:** `pdf_documents`, `pdf_extractions` tables

#### WS-122: Field Extraction Implementation
- **Business Impact:** Automated data extraction from contracts
- **Expected Location:** `/src/lib/extraction/`, `/src/lib/ocr/`
- **Technology:** OCR, ML text extraction
- **Database:** `field_mappings`, `extraction_templates` tables

### UNKNOWN FEATURES (WS-124-135)
**NOTE:** Feature specifications for WS-124-135 need to be located first

```bash
# Check if specifications exist
ls -la /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/feature-designer/WS-12[4-9]-*.md
ls -la /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/feature-designer/WS-13[0-5]-*.md

# If specs don't exist, these might be:
# - Reserved numbers
# - Future features
# - Batch that was never fully defined
```

---

## üîé INVESTIGATION METHODOLOGY

### Step 1: Locate Missing Feature Specifications
```bash
# Find all WS-12X and WS-13X specifications
find /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT -name "WS-12*.md" -o -name "WS-13*.md" | sort

# Check if features were defined but not in feature-designer
grep -r "WS-12[4-9]\|WS-13[0-5]" /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/01-PROJECT-ORCHESTRATOR/
grep -r "WS-12[4-9]\|WS-13[0-5]" /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/INBOX/

# Check original spec documents
find /CORE-SPECIFICATIONS -type f -exec grep -l "WS-12[4-9]\|WS-13[0-5]" {} \;
```

### Step 2: Check PDF Processing Implementation
```bash
# PDF processing features are critical - check thoroughly
ls -la /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/src/lib/pdf/
ls -la /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/src/lib/extraction/
ls -la /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/src/app/api/pdf*/

# Check for PDF libraries
grep -E "pdf|ocr|tesseract|extraction" /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/package.json

# Database tables for document processing
grep -r "pdf_documents\|field_extraction\|document_processing" /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/supabase/migrations/
```

### Step 3: Investigate Completed Features Pattern
```typescript
// Check what WS-118, WS-120, WS-123 actually implemented
// This might give clues about the batch's purpose

// WS-118: Supplier Profile Creation (Team A completed)
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("SupplierProfile", "", true);

// WS-120: MRR Tracking Dashboard (Team B completed)  
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("MRRTracking", "", true);

// WS-123: Smart Mapping Implementation (Team C completed)
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("SmartMapping", "", true);

// Look for patterns - are these related features?
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("WS-118|WS-120|WS-123");
```

### Step 4: Check Batch Assignment History
```bash
# Was batch 9 ever fully assigned?
ls -la /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/dev-manager/*batch9*
ls -la /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/team-*/batch9/

# Check if only partial assignments were made
find /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/team-* -name "*batch9*" -o -name "WS-12*" -o -name "WS-13*"

# Look for incomplete rounds
find /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/team-*/batch9 -name "*round-1*" | wc -l  # Should be 5
find /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/team-*/batch9 -name "*round-2*" | wc -l  # Should be 5
find /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/team-*/batch9 -name "*round-3*" | wc -l  # Should be 5
```

### Step 5: Alternative Implementation Search
```bash
# PDF processing might be implemented differently
grep -r "document.*process\|contract.*extract\|pdf.*parse" /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/

# Field extraction might use different names
grep -r "data.*extract\|field.*map\|template.*extract" /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/

# Check if features were merged into other components
grep -r "import.*pdf\|require.*pdf" /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/src/
```

## üìä BATCH 9 INVESTIGATION REPORT TEMPLATE

```markdown
# BATCH 9 INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION REPORT

## Batch Overview
- **Total Features:** 15 (WS-121 to WS-135)
- **Completed:** 3 (WS-118, WS-120, WS-123)
- **Missing:** 12 (WS-121, WS-122, WS-124-135)
- **Completion Rate:** 20%

## Feature Status Analysis

### Completed Features
| Feature | Team | Description | Quality | Integration |
|---------|------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| WS-118 | Team A | Supplier Profile Creation | [Status] | [Status] |
| WS-120 | Team B | MRR Tracking Dashboard | [Status] | [Status] |
| WS-123 | Team C | Smart Mapping | [Status] | [Status] |

### Missing Critical Features
| Feature | Description | Business Impact | Found Evidence |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| WS-121 | PDF Analysis System | HIGH - Contract automation | [None/Partial] |
| WS-122 | Field Extraction | HIGH - Data automation | [None/Partial] |

### Undefined Features (WS-124-135)
- **Specifications Found:** [Yes/No]
- **Purpose:** [Unknown/Reserved/Future]
- **Evidence:** [Any references found]

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Only 20% Complete?

#### Hypothesis 1: Partial Batch Assignment
- Only 3 features were ready for development
- Rest were placeholder numbers
- **Evidence:** [List findings]

#### Hypothesis 2: Batch Interruption
- Batch started but interrupted
- Teams reassigned to other priorities
- **Evidence:** [List findings]

#### Hypothesis 3: Feature Consolidation
- Features merged into other implementations
- Numbers reserved but not used
- **Evidence:** [List findings]

## Implementation Gaps

### PDF Processing Gap (WS-121, WS-122)
**Current State:**
- [ ] No PDF parsing library installed
- [ ] No OCR implementation found
- [ ] No extraction templates defined
- [ ] No document processing tables

**Business Impact:**
- Manual contract processing required
- No automated data extraction
- Increased processing time per contract
- Higher operational costs

### Unknown Features Gap (WS-124-135)
**Investigation Result:**
- [ ] No specifications found
- [ ] No implementation evidence
- [ ] No references in codebase
- [ ] Possible reserved numbers

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **PDF Processing (WS-121, WS-122)**
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Assign to: Team D (document expertise)
   - Timeline: Next sprint
   - Dependencies: PDF libraries, OCR service

2. **Feature Definition (WS-124-135)**
   - Determine if needed
   - Create specifications if required
   - Or officially mark as reserved/unused

### Process Improvements
1. Ensure all batch features are fully specified before assignment
2. Track partial batch completions in status system
3. Document when features are consolidated or cancelled
```

## üéØ SPECIAL INVESTIGATION: WS-136

**Note:** WS-136 exists in feature-designer but is isolated:
```bash
# Investigate WS-136 separately
ls -la /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/feature-designer/WS-136-*.md

# This might be:
# - Start of Batch 10
# - Standalone critical feature
# - Emergency addition

# Check implementation
grep -r "WS-136" /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/
```

## üí° PATTERN RECOGNITION

### Batch Completion Patterns
- **Batch 1:** 5 of 15 completed (33%)
- **Batch 2:** 15 of 15 completed (100%)
- **Batch 3:** 0 of 15 completed (0%) - Duplicate batch?
- **Batch 4:** 10 of 15 completed (67%)
- **Batch 5:** 15 of 15 completed (100%)
- **Batch 6:** 15 of 15 completed (100%)
- **Batch 7:** 15 of 15 completed (100%)
- **Batch 8:** 15 of 15 completed (100%)
- **Batch 9:** 3 of 15 completed (20%)

**Observation:** Early and late batches have lower completion rates
