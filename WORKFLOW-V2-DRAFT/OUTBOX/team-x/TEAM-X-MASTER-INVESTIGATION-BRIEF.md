## üîç INVESTIGATION METHODOLOGY

### Standard Process for Each Investigation:

1. **File System Check**
   - Look for components in expected locations
   - Check for differently named implementations
   - Verify API routes exist

2. **Database Verification**
   - Search for migration files
   - Check if tables were created
   - Verify schema matches specifications

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Look for unit tests
   - Check E2E test files
   - Verify test execution results

4. **Git History**
   - Search commits for WS-XXX references
   - Check for feature branch merges
   - Look for related PRs

5. **Alternative Implementation**
   - Features might be named differently
   - Could be merged into other components
   - Check for consolidated implementations

## üìà INVESTIGATION PRIORITIES

### CRITICAL (Investigate First)
1. **Batch 3 (WS-031-045):** Entire batch missing - could be major gap
2. **Batch 4 Growth (WS-046-055):** Revenue features missing

### HIGH (Investigate Second)
3. **Batch 1 UI (WS-006-015):** Core components potentially missing
4. **Batch 9 PDF (WS-121-122):** Automation features incomplete

### MEDIUM (Investigate Third)
5. **Individual Features (WS-081, WS-119):** Specific gaps
