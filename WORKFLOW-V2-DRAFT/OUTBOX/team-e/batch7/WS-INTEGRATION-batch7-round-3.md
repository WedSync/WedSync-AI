# TEAM E - ROUND 3: WS-INTEGRATION - Cross-Team Integration & Quality Assurance

**Date:** 2025-08-22  
**Feature ID:** WS-INTEGRATION (Track all work with this ID)
**Priority:** P0 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Coordinate cross-team integration, validate system cohesion, and ensure quality across all batch 7 deliverables  
**Context:** You are Team E coordinating final integration across all teams for batch 7 completion.

## 🎯 USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** WedSync development team
**I want to:** Have all testing, deployment, and monitoring systems working together seamlessly
**So that:** Wedding suppliers can rely on a bulletproof platform that's thoroughly tested, safely deployed, and continuously monitored

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
A perfect testing suite, deployment pipeline, and monitoring system work individually but fail to integrate properly, causing blind spots during critical wedding season deployments. Cross-team integration ensures all systems work together to provide complete platform reliability.

// 1. LOAD CORRECT UI STYLE GUIDE:
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. CONTEXT7 MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
await mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("playwright");
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/microsoft/playwright", "integration testing", 5000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/vitest-dev/vitest", "cross-system testing", 3000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/actions/toolkit", "workflow integration", 2000);

// 3. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// 4. REVIEW existing patterns from all teams:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("integration", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("/tests");
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("/.github/workflows");
