## 🎯 USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding supplier evaluating WedSync Professional features
**I want to:** Experience the full platform capabilities for 30 days without payment commitment
**So that:** I can validate ROI before making a financial commitment and see measurable business impact

**Real Business Scenario:**
A wedding photographer signs up for a free trial after seeing competitor success stories. During the 30-day trial, they connect 8 couples, automate their client intake process, and save 12 hours per week on administrative tasks. On day 25, they receive personalized trial results showing $2,400 in time savings value. They upgrade to Professional before trial expiration, increasing annual revenue by $18,000 while working fewer hours.

## 📚 STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. LOAD CORRECT UI STYLE GUIDE (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK):
// For ALL OTHER UI features (General SaaS components):
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. CONTEXT7 MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
await mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("recharts");  // Get correct library ID first
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/recharts/recharts", "analytics-charts conversion-tracking", 5000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/vercel/next.js", "email-automation api-optimization", 3000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/supabase/supabase", "advanced-analytics triggers", 2000);

// For this specific feature, also load:
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss", "data-visualization analytics-ui", 2000);

// 2. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// 3. REVIEW existing patterns from Round 1:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("TrialManager", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("/src/lib/trial/");

// NOW you have current docs + existing trial context. Agents can work intelligently!
```

**WHY THIS ORDER MATTERS:**
- Context7 ensures advanced analytics and visualization patterns
- Serena shows Round 1 trial foundations to build upon
- Agents work with complete trial system knowledge

---

## 🚀 STEP 2: LAUNCH PARALLEL AGENTS (AFTER documentation loaded!)

**NOW that you have current docs, launch agents with specific knowledge:**

1. **task-tracker-coordinator** --think-hard --with-context7-docs "Advanced trial analytics and conversion optimization"
2. **data-analytics-engineer** --think-hard --use-loaded-docs "ROI calculations and predictive conversion scoring"
3. **react-ui-specialist** --think-ultra-hard --follow-existing-patterns "Advanced trial dashboard with analytics visualization" 
4. **security-compliance-officer** --think-ultra-hard --check-current-best-practices
5. **test-automation-architect** --complex-flows --use-testing-patterns-from-docs
6. **playwright-visual-testing-specialist** --accessibility-first --multi-user-flows
7. **code-quality-guardian** --advanced-patterns --match-codebase-style

**AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** "Use the Context7 docs loaded in Step 1. Build on Round 1 trial foundations."

**AGENT USAGE TARGET:** >75% of session time in parallel execution

---

## 📋 STEP 3: DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (With loaded docs + agents)

### **EXPLORE PHASE (NO CODING!)**
- Read ALL Round 1 trial implementation
- Understand current ROI calculation patterns
- Check integration points with analytics and email systems
- Review advanced trial optimization strategies
- Continue until trial enhancement features are FULLY understood

### **PLAN PHASE (THINK HARD!)**
- Create detailed enhancement plan for Round 2
- Write test cases FIRST for complex conversion flows (TDD)
- Plan advanced analytics and email automation architecture
- Consider edge cases in conversion optimization
- Don't rush - advanced trial systems require precision

### **CODE PHASE (PARALLEL AGENTS!)**
- Write comprehensive tests before implementation
- Follow patterns established in Round 1
- Use Context7 examples for advanced analytics
- Implement with parallel agents focusing on conversion
- Focus on personalization and optimization

### **COMMIT PHASE (VERIFY EVERYTHING!)**
- Run all tests including complex conversion scenarios
- Verify with Playwright advanced trial flows
- Create evidence package
- Generate analytics reports
