# TEAM E - ROUND 3: WS-132 - Trial Management System - Final Integration & Production

**Date:** 2025-01-24  
**Feature ID:** WS-132 (Track all work with this ID)  
**Priority:** HIGH from roadmap  
**Mission:** Complete trial system integration with production optimization and comprehensive business intelligence  
**Context:** You are Team E working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before deployment.

---

## üéØ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding supplier evaluating WedSync Professional features
**I want to:** Experience the full platform capabilities for 30 days without payment commitment
**So that:** I can validate ROI before making a financial commitment and see measurable business impact

**Real Business Scenario:**
A wedding photographer signs up for a free trial after seeing competitor success stories. During the 30-day trial, they connect 8 couples, automate their client intake process, and save 12 hours per week on administrative tasks. On day 25, they receive personalized trial results showing $2,400 in time savings value. They upgrade to Professional before trial expiration, increasing annual revenue by $18,000 while working fewer hours.

## üìö STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. LOAD CORRECT UI STYLE GUIDE (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK):
// For ALL OTHER UI features (General SaaS components):
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. CONTEXT7 MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
await mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("next.js");  // Get correct library ID first
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/vercel/next.js", "production-deployment monitoring", 5000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/supabase/supabase", "production-analytics triggers", 3000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/recharts/recharts", "business-intelligence dashboards", 2000);

// For this specific feature, also load:
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss", "production-ui optimization", 2000);

// 2. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// 3. REVIEW integration patterns from Round 2:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("TrialAnalyticsService", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("/src/lib/trial/");

// NOW you have current docs + trial context. Agents can work intelligently!
```

**WHY THIS ORDER MATTERS:**
- Context7 ensures production-ready optimization patterns
- Serena shows Round 2 trial foundations to build upon
- Agents work with complete trial system integration knowledge

---

## üöÄ STEP 2: LAUNCH PARALLEL AGENTS (AFTER documentation loaded!)

**NOW that you have current docs, launch agents with specific knowledge:**

1. **task-tracker-coordinator** --think-hard --with-context7-docs "Final trial system integration and deployment"
2. **data-analytics-engineer** --think-hard --use-loaded-docs "Production business intelligence and trial performance tracking"
3. **performance-optimization-expert** --think-ultra-hard --follow-existing-patterns "Trial system optimization and caching strategies" 
4. **security-compliance-officer** --think-ultra-hard --check-current-best-practices
5. **test-automation-architect** --e2e-focus --use-testing-patterns-from-docs
6. **playwright-visual-testing-specialist** --accessibility-first --production-validation
7. **code-quality-guardian** --production-ready --match-codebase-style

**AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** "Use the Context7 docs loaded in Step 1. Focus on production readiness and team integration."

**AGENT USAGE TARGET:** >75% of session time in parallel execution

---

## üìã STEP 3: DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (With loaded docs + agents)

### **EXPLORE PHASE (NO CODING!)**
- Read ALL team integration outputs from Round 2
- Understand complete trial system architecture with AI integrations
- Check all cross-team dependencies and usage tracking flows
- Review production deployment requirements for trial systems
- Continue until system integration is FULLY understood

### **PLAN PHASE (THINK HARD!)**
- Create comprehensive integration plan for final round
- Write production test cases FIRST (TDD)
- Plan monitoring and alerting strategies for trial conversion systems
- Consider production scalability requirements for high-volume trials
- Don't rush - final trial integration requires precision

### **CODE PHASE (PARALLEL AGENTS!)**
- Write comprehensive tests before implementation
- Follow production-ready patterns for trial systems
- Use Context7 examples for performance optimization
- Implement with parallel agents focusing on business value
- Focus on reliability and business intelligence, not just functionality

### **COMMIT PHASE (VERIFY EVERYTHING!)**
- Run all tests including complex integration scenarios
- Verify with comprehensive Playwright business intelligence testing
- Create complete evidence package for trial performance
- Generate production readiness reports for conversion systems
- Only mark complete when PRODUCTION READY
