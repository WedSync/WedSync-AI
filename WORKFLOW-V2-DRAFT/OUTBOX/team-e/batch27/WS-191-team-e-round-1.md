# TEAM E — BATCH 27 — ROUND 1 — WS-191 - Backup Procedures - Testing & Validation Framework

**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Feature ID:** WS-191 (Track all work with this ID)  
**Priority:** P1 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Build comprehensive testing framework for backup system validation and disaster recovery testing  
**Context:** You are Team E working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before next round.

## 🎯 USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** WedSync database administrator responsible for protecting wedding vendor and couple data
**I want to:** Implement automated backup procedures with multiple recovery points and disaster recovery capabilities
**So that:** I can protect critical wedding data from loss, ensure business continuity during peak wedding seasons, and meet data recovery SLAs that prevent couples from losing their wedding planning progress or vendors from losing client information

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
A database corruption occurs during peak wedding season (June) affecting 2,000+ active wedding timelines just weeks before ceremonies. With proper backup procedures, WedSync automatically maintained point-in-time backups every hour, full daily backups for 30 days, and weekly archives for 12 months. The system can restore to any point within the last 30 days, minimizing data loss to under 1 hour, ensuring couples don't lose their vendor communications, timeline updates, or payment records during this critical period.

## 🧠 SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP FOR COMPLEX FEATURE ANALYSIS

### When to Use Sequential Thinking

Before diving into coding, use Sequential Thinking MCP when facing:

- **Complex Feature Architecture**: Multi-component systems with intricate dependencies
- **Integration Challenges**: Features that span multiple systems and require coordination  
- **Business Logic Complexity**: Wedding-specific rules that need careful analysis
- **Technical Trade-offs**: Choosing between multiple implementation approaches
- **Debugging Complex Issues**: Root cause analysis for multi-system problems

### Sequential Thinking Patterns for Development Teams

#### Pattern 1: Feature Architecture Analysis
```typescript
// Before starting complex feature development
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This task tracking feature needs to integrate with existing task creation (WS-156), helper assignment (WS-157), and real-time notifications. Need to analyze data flow and identify potential integration points.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Data flow analysis: User creates task -> assigns helpers -> helpers update status -> triggers notifications -> updates progress indicators. Each step requires API endpoints, validation, and error handling.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

#### Pattern 2: Integration Strategy Planning  
```typescript
// When coordinating with other teams' work
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Team A is building UI components, Team C is handling real-time updates, and Team E is implementing testing. Need to define clear API contracts and data structures that all teams can use.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 3
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "API contract definition: /api/tasks/status endpoints need to support CRUD operations, validation schemas, and webhook events. Response format should match Team A's UI expectations.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 3
});
```

#### Pattern 3: Business Logic Analysis
```typescript
// When implementing wedding-specific business rules
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding task tracking has unique requirements: tasks can be delegated to multiple helpers, status updates need photo evidence for critical tasks, and deadlines are tied to wedding date proximity.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Business rule implementation: Critical tasks (venue confirmation, catering numbers) require photo evidence. Non-critical tasks (decoration pickup) can be marked complete without evidence. Need validation logic for each task type.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

### Using Sequential Thinking in Your Development Process

1. **Before Documentation Loading**: Use Sequential Thinking to understand the full scope and complexity
2. **During Planning Phase**: Structure your approach to handle all edge cases and integration points  
3. **When Stuck**: Use Sequential Thinking to work through complex problems systematically
4. **For Reviews**: Use Sequential Thinking to verify your implementation covers all requirements

**Remember**: Complex features require systematic thinking. Use Sequential Thinking MCP to ensure thorough analysis before implementation.

## 📚 STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

```typescript
// 1. LOAD TESTING DOCUMENTATION:
await mcp__Ref__ref_resolve_library_id("vitest");
await mcp__Ref__ref_get_library_docs("/vitest-dev/vitest", "integration-testing mocking", 5000);
await mcp__Ref__ref_get_library_docs("/microsoft/playwright", "testing-automation e2e", 3000);
await mcp__Ref__ref_get_library_docs("/supabase/supabase", "testing backup-validation", 2000);

// 2. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// 3. REVIEW existing patterns before creating new ones:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("test", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("/tests/");
```

    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/admin/backup')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${regularUser.token}`)
      .send({ operation: 'create' });
    
    expect(response.status).toBe(403);
  });

  test('recovery operations require super admin', async () => {
    const adminUser = await createTestUser('admin');
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/admin/recovery')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${adminUser.token}`)
      .send({ restore_point: '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z' });
    
    expect(response.status).toBe(403); // Should require super admin
  });
});
```

**2. Data Protection Testing:**
```typescript
// Validate sensitive data protection in backups
describe('Backup Data Protection', () => {
  test('sensitive data is encrypted in backups', async () => {
    const testData = await createTestWeddingData();
    await backupOrchestrator.createBackup();
    
    const backupContent = await getBackupContent();
    expect(backupContent).not.toContain(testData.couple.email); // Should be encrypted
    expect(backupContent).not.toContain(testData.supplier.password); // Should be hashed
  });
});
```
