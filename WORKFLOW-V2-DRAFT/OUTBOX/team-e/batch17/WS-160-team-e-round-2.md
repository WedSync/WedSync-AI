## 🎯 USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding couple coordinating their wedding day schedule
**I want to:** Create a comprehensive timeline from getting ready to send-off with automatic time calculations and conflict detection
**So that:** All suppliers and helpers know exactly when and where to be, preventing delays and ensuring smooth transitions between events

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Timeline management is critical for wedding day success - a single mistake in timing can cascade into delays affecting the entire event. This comprehensive testing ensures the timeline system is bulletproof, with accurate calculations, reliable conflict detection, and smooth collaborative editing under load.


## 🌐 BROWSER MCP INTERACTIVE TESTING (NEW!)

**🚀 Real Browser Automation with Browser MCP:**

The Browser MCP provides interactive browser testing capabilities that complement Playwright MCP:

```javascript
// BROWSER MCP - Interactive Visual Testing
// Use for real-time UI validation and user flow testing

// 1. NAVIGATE AND CAPTURE STATE
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/dashboard"});
const snapshot = await mcp__browsermcp__browser_snapshot();

// 2. INTERACTIVE FORM TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_click({
  element: "Login button",
  ref: snapshot.querySelector('[data-testid="login-btn"]')
});

await mcp__browsermcp__browser_type({
  element: "Email input field", 
  ref: snapshot.querySelector('input[type="email"]'),
  text: "test@wedding.com",
  submit: false
});

// 3. VISUAL REGRESSION TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_screenshot(); // Captures current state

// 4. RESPONSIVE TESTING
for (const width of [375, 768, 1024, 1920]) {
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_resize({width, height: 800});
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_wait({time: 1});
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_screenshot();
}

// 5. CONSOLE AND NETWORK MONITORING
const logs = await mcp__browsermcp__browser_get_console_logs();
const hasErrors = logs.some(log => log.level === 'error');

// 6. MULTI-TAB TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_tabs({action: "new"});
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/settings"});
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_tabs({action: "select", index: 0});
```

**Browser MCP vs Playwright MCP:**
- **Browser MCP**: Interactive, visual, real-time testing during development
- **Playwright MCP**: Automated, programmatic, CI/CD testing
- **Use Both**: Browser MCP for exploration, Playwright MCP for automation
