## 🧠 SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP FOR COMPLEX FEATURE ANALYSIS

### When to Use Sequential Thinking

Before diving into coding, use Sequential Thinking MCP when facing:

- **Complex Feature Architecture**: Multi-component systems with intricate dependencies
- **Integration Challenges**: Features that span multiple systems and require coordination  
- **Business Logic Complexity**: Wedding-specific rules that need careful analysis
- **Technical Trade-offs**: Choosing between multiple implementation approaches
- **Debugging Complex Issues**: Root cause analysis for multi-system problems

### Sequential Thinking Patterns for Development Teams

#### Pattern 1: Feature Architecture Analysis
```typescript
// Before starting complex feature development
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This task tracking feature needs to integrate with existing task creation (WS-156), helper assignment (WS-157), and real-time notifications. Need to analyze data flow and identify potential integration points.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Data flow analysis: User creates task -> assigns helpers -> helpers update status -> triggers notifications -> updates progress indicators. Each step requires API endpoints, validation, and error handling.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

#### Pattern 2: Integration Strategy Planning  
```typescript
// When coordinating with other teams' work
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Team A is building UI components, Team C is handling real-time updates, and Team E is implementing testing. Need to define clear API contracts and data structures that all teams can use.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 3
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "API contract definition: /api/tasks/status endpoints need to support CRUD operations, validation schemas, and webhook events. Response format should match Team A's UI expectations.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 3
});
```

#### Pattern 3: Business Logic Analysis
```typescript
// When implementing wedding-specific business rules
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding task tracking has unique requirements: tasks can be delegated to multiple helpers, status updates need photo evidence for critical tasks, and deadlines are tied to wedding date proximity.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Business rule implementation: Critical tasks (venue confirmation, catering numbers) require photo evidence. Non-critical tasks (decoration pickup) can be marked complete without evidence. Need validation logic for each task type.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

### Using Sequential Thinking in Your Development Process

1. **Before Documentation Loading**: Use Sequential Thinking to understand the full scope and complexity
2. **During Planning Phase**: Structure your approach to handle all edge cases and integration points  
3. **When Stuck**: Use Sequential Thinking to work through complex problems systematically
4. **For Reviews**: Use Sequential Thinking to verify your implementation covers all requirements

**Remember**: Complex features require systematic thinking. Use Sequential Thinking MCP to ensure thorough analysis before implementation.

## 📚 STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. Ref MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
// Library ID resolution no longer needed with Ref MCP
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "playwright testing patterns latest documentation"});
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "vitest unit-testing latest documentation"});
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "react testing library component-testing latest documentation"});

// For load testing:
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "artillery load-testing latest documentation"});

// 2. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// 3. REVIEW existing patterns before creating new ones:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("test", "tests/", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("tests/");
```

## 📋 STEP 3: DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (With loaded docs + agents)

### **EXPLORE PHASE (NO CODING!)**
- Read existing test patterns and frameworks
- Understand testing data setup and teardown
- Check existing mock patterns for external services
- Review test coverage requirements and reporting
- Continue until you FULLY understand testing architecture

### **PLAN PHASE (THINK HARD!)**
- Create comprehensive testing strategy document
- Plan test data scenarios and edge cases
- Design performance testing benchmarks
- Plan security testing attack vectors
- Don't rush - comprehensive testing requires careful planning

### **TEST FIRST APPROACH (CRITICAL!)**
- Define test cases before teams implement features
- Create test data fixtures and factories
- Set up continuous testing infrastructure
- Implement testing utilities and helpers
- Focus on catching bugs before they reach production

## 🔒 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### MANDATORY SECURITY TESTING IMPLEMENTATION

```typescript
// ✅ ALWAYS DO THIS (MANDATORY PATTERN):
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

describe('Payment Calendar Security Tests', () => {
  test('should prevent unauthorized access to payment data', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test without authentication
    await page.goto('/api/payments/unauthorized-couple-id');
    const response = await page.waitForResponse('/api/payments/unauthorized-couple-id');
    expect(response.status()).toBe(401);
  });
  
  test('should validate payment amount inputs', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test malicious input injection
    await page.goto('/payments/calendar');
    await page.fill('[data-testid="payment-amount"]', '<script>alert("xss")</script>');
    
    // Should sanitize and reject invalid input
    const errorMessage = await page.locator('[data-testid="validation-error"]');
    await expect(errorMessage).toContainText('Invalid amount');
  });
  
  test('should enforce CSRF protection on payment updates', async ({ page, context }) => {
    // Test CSRF token validation
    const response = await context.request.patch('/api/payments/test-payment', {
      data: { status: 'paid' },
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
      // Missing CSRF token
    });
    expect(response.status()).toBe(403);
  });
});
```

### SECURITY TESTING CHECKLIST:
- [ ] **Authentication Testing**: Verify all payment endpoints require authentication
- [ ] **Authorization Testing**: Ensure users can only access their own payment data
- [ ] **Input Validation Testing**: Test XSS, SQL injection, and malformed data
- [ ] **CSRF Testing**: Verify CSRF protection on all state-changing operations
- [ ] **Data Exposure Testing**: Ensure sensitive payment data is not exposed in logs

for (const width of mobileBreakpoints) {
  test(`Payment calendar responsive at ${width}px`, async ({ page }) => {
    await mcp__playwright__browser_resize({width, height: 800});
    await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({url: "/payments/calendar"});
    
    const snapshot = await mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot();
    
    // Verify critical elements are visible and accessible
    const calendarVisible = await page.locator('[data-testid="payment-calendar"]').isVisible();
    const paymentsVisible = await page.locator('[data-testid="payment-list"]').isVisible();
    
    expect(calendarVisible).toBe(true);
    expect(paymentsVisible).toBe(true);
    
    // Test touch interactions on mobile breakpoints
    if (width <= 768) {
      // Test mobile-specific interactions
      await mcp__playwright__browser_click({
        element: "Mobile payment item",
