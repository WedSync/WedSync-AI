## 🎯 USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding photographer relying on the portfolio management system for my business
**I want to:** Absolute confidence that the system works flawlessly under all conditions, from peak wedding season loads to edge case scenarios
**So that:** I never lose client work, experience downtime during critical portfolio updates, or encounter bugs that could cost me bookings worth thousands of dollars

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Wedding suppliers can't afford portfolio system failures. A photographer uploading their best work from a $10,000 wedding needs guarantee the system won't corrupt images, lose metadata, or crash during peak Saturday uploads when 50+ photographers upload simultaneously. Comprehensive testing prevents business-critical failures.


## 🌐 BROWSER MCP INTERACTIVE TESTING (NEW!)

**🚀 Real Browser Automation with Browser MCP:**

The Browser MCP provides interactive browser testing capabilities that complement Playwright MCP:

```javascript
// BROWSER MCP - Interactive Visual Testing
// Use for real-time UI validation and user flow testing

// 1. NAVIGATE AND CAPTURE STATE
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/dashboard"});
const snapshot = await mcp__browsermcp__browser_snapshot();

// 2. INTERACTIVE FORM TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_click({
  element: "Login button",
  ref: snapshot.querySelector('[data-testid="login-btn"]')
});

await mcp__browsermcp__browser_type({
  element: "Email input field", 
  ref: snapshot.querySelector('input[type="email"]'),
  text: "test@wedding.com",
  submit: false
});

// 3. VISUAL REGRESSION TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_screenshot(); // Captures current state

// 4. RESPONSIVE TESTING
for (const width of [375, 768, 1024, 1920]) {
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_resize({width, height: 800});
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_wait({time: 1});
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_screenshot();
}

// 5. CONSOLE AND NETWORK MONITORING
const logs = await mcp__browsermcp__browser_get_console_logs();
const hasErrors = logs.some(log => log.level === 'error');

// 6. MULTI-TAB TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_tabs({action: "new"});
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/settings"});
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_tabs({action: "select", index: 0});
```

**Browser MCP vs Playwright MCP:**
- **Browser MCP**: Interactive, visual, real-time testing during development
- **Playwright MCP**: Automated, programmatic, CI/CD testing
- **Use Both**: Browser MCP for exploration, Playwright MCP for automation

## 🧠 SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP FOR COMPLEX FEATURE ANALYSIS

### When to Use Sequential Thinking

Before diving into coding, use Sequential Thinking MCP when facing:

- **Complex Feature Architecture**: Multi-component systems with intricate dependencies
- **Integration Challenges**: Features that span multiple systems and require coordination  
- **Business Logic Complexity**: Wedding-specific rules that need careful analysis
- **Technical Trade-offs**: Choosing between multiple implementation approaches
- **Debugging Complex Issues**: Root cause analysis for multi-system problems

### Sequential Thinking Patterns for Development Teams

#### Pattern 1: Feature Architecture Analysis
```typescript
// Before starting complex feature development
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This task tracking feature needs to integrate with existing task creation (WS-156), helper assignment (WS-157), and real-time notifications. Need to analyze data flow and identify potential integration points.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Data flow analysis: User creates task -> assigns helpers -> helpers update status -> triggers notifications -> updates progress indicators. Each step requires API endpoints, validation, and error handling.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

#### Pattern 2: Integration Strategy Planning  
```typescript
// When coordinating with other teams' work
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Team A is building UI components, Team C is handling real-time updates, and Team E is implementing testing. Need to define clear API contracts and data structures that all teams can use.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 3
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "API contract definition: /api/tasks/status endpoints need to support CRUD operations, validation schemas, and webhook events. Response format should match Team A's UI expectations.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 3
});
```

#### Pattern 3: Business Logic Analysis
```typescript
// When implementing wedding-specific business rules
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding task tracking has unique requirements: tasks can be delegated to multiple helpers, status updates need photo evidence for critical tasks, and deadlines are tied to wedding date proximity.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Business rule implementation: Critical tasks (venue confirmation, catering numbers) require photo evidence. Non-critical tasks (decoration pickup) can be marked complete without evidence. Need validation logic for each task type.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

### Using Sequential Thinking in Your Development Process

1. **Before Documentation Loading**: Use Sequential Thinking to understand the full scope and complexity
2. **During Planning Phase**: Structure your approach to handle all edge cases and integration points  
3. **When Stuck**: Use Sequential Thinking to work through complex problems systematically
4. **For Reviews**: Use Sequential Thinking to verify your implementation covers all requirements

**Remember**: Complex features require systematic thinking. Use Sequential Thinking MCP to ensure thorough analysis before implementation.
