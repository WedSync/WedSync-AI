    // Validate recommendation diversity and avoid bias
    // Measure prediction accuracy with statistical significance
  });
  
  test('Machine learning model drift detection', async () => {
    // Monitor model performance degradation over time
    // Detect data drift and recommendation quality changes
    // Automated retraining triggers and validation
  });
});

// /wedsync/tests/cross-platform/collaborative-sync.spec.ts
describe('Cross-Platform Collaborative Testing', () => {
  test('Multi-device real-time template editing', async () => {
    // Test simultaneous editing across mobile, tablet, desktop
    // Validate real-time synchronization accuracy
    // Verify conflict resolution across platforms
  });
});

// /wedsync/src/lib/monitoring/advanced-analytics.ts
export class AdvancedAnalyticsEngine {
  async trackTemplateSystemHealth(): Promise<HealthMetrics> {
    // Comprehensive system health monitoring
    // Performance regression detection
    // User experience impact measurement
  }
  
  async predictSystemFailures(): Promise<FailurePrediction[]> {
    // Predictive analytics for system stability
    // Early warning system for potential issues
    // Automated mitigation recommendations
  }
}
```
