# TEAM E - ROUND 2: WS-157 - Helper Assignment - Advanced Testing & Quality Assurance

**Date:** 2025-01-25  
**Feature ID:** WS-157 (Track all work with this ID)  
**Priority:** P1 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Build comprehensive testing suite for helper assignment with performance validation and security testing  
**Context:** You are Team E working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before next round.

## ðŸŽ¯ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding couple delegating tasks to family and friends
**I want to:** Assign specific wedding tasks to helpers with clear instructions and timing
**So that:** Everyone knows their responsibilities and can execute tasks without confusion on the wedding day

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
A couple currently creates handwritten task lists like "Mom - handle gifts table" without clear timing or instructions. With this feature, they assign "Mary Johnson - Gift table setup (5:00pm-5:30pm) - Set up gift table in foyer, arrange card box, ensure gift security" with automatic notifications and check-in reminders.

## ðŸ“š STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

```typescript
// 1. LOAD CORRECT UI STYLE GUIDE:
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. CONTEXT7 MCP - Load latest docs:
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/microsoft/playwright", "testing automation", 5000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/vitest-dev/vitest", "unit-testing", 3000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/dequelabs/axe-core", "accessibility-testing", 2000);

// 3. SERENA MCP - Initialize:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);

// 4. REVIEW existing Round 1 work:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("HelperAssignmentTest", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("/tests");
```
