## üíù The Communication Integration Challenge
**Context**: A vendor needs to notify the couple about a last-minute venue change, but the couple is traveling with poor WiFi. Your integrations must deliver this critical message via SMS backup, send email copies to the wedding planner, and trigger push notifications. **Every message channel failure could mean a missed wedding detail**.
