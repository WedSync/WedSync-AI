**FEATURE ID:** WS-293 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about mobile architecture visualization, WedMe platform monitoring, and responsive system health indicators

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/mobile/architecture/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/mobile/architecture/MobileArchitectureDashboard.tsx | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## üìö STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query mobile architecture and WedMe platform patterns
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("mobile architecture wedme platform monitoring system");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("MobileApp WedMeApp PlatformMonitor", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/mobile/");
```

### B. UI STYLE GUIDES & TECHNOLOGY STACK (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Load the correct UI Style Guide for mobile platform features
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// MANDATORY: Mobile-first responsive design patterns
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("responsive mobile design PWA architecture");
```

**üö® CRITICAL UI TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
- **Untitled UI**: Primary component library (MANDATORY)
- **Magic UI**: Animations and visual enhancements (MANDATORY)
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.11**: Utility-first CSS with mobile-first approach
- **Lucide React**: Icons ONLY

**‚ùå DO NOT USE:**
- Radix UI, Catalyst UI, shadcn/ui, or any other component libraries

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation SPECIFIC to mobile architecture monitoring
mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("mobile system monitoring PWA architecture dashboard responsive design real-time health indicators");
mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("wedding platform mobile architecture WedMe system integration patterns");
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Complex Mobile Architecture Analysis
```typescript
// Use for complex mobile architecture decisions
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Mobile architecture monitoring requires touch-optimized interfaces, offline capability analysis, PWA health indicators, and WedMe-specific system monitoring that works on smaller screens with simplified but comprehensive information display",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking({
  thought: "WedMe platform integration means creating system health dashboards that couples can understand - not technical admin interfaces. This requires wedding-context health indicators like 'Your wedding data is safe', 'Photo upload working perfectly', 'All vendors connected'",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 5
});
```

## üöÄ STEP 2B: LAUNCH ENHANCED AGENTS WITH SPECIFIC MISSIONS
