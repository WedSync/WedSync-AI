# TEAM E - ROUND 1: WS-293 - Technical Architecture Main Overview
## 2025-09-03 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Create comprehensive QA testing strategy and documentation for technical architecture monitoring system with cross-platform validation
**FEATURE ID:** WS-293 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about system architecture testing patterns, cross-team integration validation, and comprehensive documentation for complex technical monitoring

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **TEST SUITE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/architecture/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/architecture/technical-architecture.test.ts | head -20
```

2. **TEST EXECUTION RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern=architecture
# MUST show: "All tests passing" with >90% coverage
```

3. **DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/docs/architecture/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/docs/architecture/WS-293-technical-monitoring-guide.md | head -20
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated testing implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## 📚 STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query existing testing patterns for system monitoring and architecture validation
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("testing architecture monitoring system health validation");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("test describe beforeEach architecture", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/");
```

### B. TESTING & DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS (MANDATORY FOR QA WORK)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Load testing methodology and documentation standards
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// Load existing test patterns for consistency
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("jest react-testing-library playwright test patterns");
```

**🚨 CRITICAL TESTING TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
- **Jest**: Unit and integration testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing with user-centric approach
- **Playwright MCP**: E2E testing with browser automation
- **MSW**: API mocking for integration tests
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: Enhanced DOM assertions

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation SPECIFIC to architecture testing and technical monitoring validation
mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("system architecture testing monitoring validation patterns jest playwright integration");
mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("technical documentation architecture guides system health monitoring QA patterns");
```

## 🧠 STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING STRATEGY

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Complex Testing Architecture Planning
```typescript
// Use for comprehensive testing strategy development
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Technical architecture monitoring requires multi-layer testing: unit tests for individual system health components, integration tests for real-time monitoring data flow, E2E tests for complete architecture dashboard workflows, and performance tests for system load monitoring accuracy",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 6
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Cross-team validation is critical - Team A's desktop UI, Team B's API monitoring, Team C's integration health, and Team D's mobile interface must work together seamlessly. Testing strategy needs to validate data consistency across all interfaces and ensure real-time system health data synchronization",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 6
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Wedding-specific testing scenarios are essential: Saturday wedding day load testing, vendor system connectivity testing, real-time architecture alerts during high-traffic periods, and system recovery validation for wedding-critical components",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 6
});
```
