# TEAM A - ROUND 1: WS-339 - Performance Monitoring System
## 2025-01-22 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build comprehensive performance monitoring dashboard with real-time wedding day performance tracking, system health visualization, and wedding-critical performance alerts
**FEATURE ID:** WS-339 (Track all work with this ID)

## ðŸŽ¯ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION - PERFORMANCE MONITORING UI

### WEDDING CONTEXT PERFORMANCE SCENARIOS

**Wedding Day Performance Monitoring:**
- Sarah's wedding: 200 guests accessing timeline simultaneously
- Real-time photo uploads during ceremony causing bandwidth spikes  
- Vendor coordination requiring sub-200ms response times
- Critical path monitoring for wedding day operations

### CORE PERFORMANCE UI COMPONENTS

#### 1. Wedding Day Performance Dashboard
```typescript
// components/performance/WeddingDayPerformanceDashboard.tsx
const WeddingDayPerformanceDashboard: React.FC = () => {
  // Real-time performance metrics for active weddings
  // Critical path monitoring (guest arrival, ceremony, reception)
  // Response time tracking for wedding-critical operations
  // Resource utilization during peak wedding hours
  
  return (
    <div className="wedding-performance-dashboard">
      <ActiveWeddingsOverview />
      <CriticalPathMonitor />
      <ResponseTimeMetrics />
      <ResourceUtilization />
      <PerformanceAlerts />
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### 2. System Health Visualizer
```typescript
// components/performance/SystemHealthVisualizer.tsx
const SystemHealthVisualizer: React.FC = () => {
  // Database performance with wedding query optimization
  // API response time tracking for vendor integrations
  // Photo upload performance and CDN health
  // Mobile app performance metrics
  
  return (
    <div className="system-health-visualizer">
      <DatabaseHealth />
      <APIPerformanceMetrics />
      <CDNHealthStatus />
      <MobilePerformanceTracker />
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### 3. Wedding Performance Alerts
```typescript
// components/performance/WeddingPerformanceAlerts.tsx
const WeddingPerformanceAlerts: React.FC = () => {
  // Automated alerts for wedding day performance issues
  // Escalation procedures for critical performance degradation
  // Performance impact assessment on ongoing weddings
  
  return (
    <div className="wedding-performance-alerts">
      <CriticalAlerts />
      <EscalationProcedures />
      <WeddingImpactAssessment />
    </div>
  );
};
```
