# TEAM C - ROUND 1: WS-286 - Advanced Form Builder
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build real-time form collaboration and wedding platform integration with automated form distribution
**FEATURE ID:** WS-286 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about collaborative form building and seamless wedding platform integration

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/integrations/form-builder/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/integrations/form-builder/FormCollaborationManager.ts | head -20
```

## üß† SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Real-time Form Integration Strategy
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Form collaboration requirements: Real-time form editing with conflict resolution, shared form templates across wedding team, automated form distribution to guests/vendors, integration with existing wedding platforms (WeddingWire, The Knot), form response aggregation from multiple sources, webhook notifications for form completions.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding platform integration: Forms must sync with guest management systems, integrate with vendor communication platforms, connect to wedding website builders, support calendar integration for RSVP deadlines, link with timeline management tools, coordinate with budget tracking systems.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Form distribution automation: Smart sending based on wedding timeline (save-the-dates ‚Üí RSVP ‚Üí final details), guest segmentation (local vs. destination, dietary needs), vendor workflow automation (contracts ‚Üí timeline ‚Üí final details), reminder sequences with escalation, multi-channel delivery (email, SMS, app notifications).",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Integration architecture: Supabase realtime for collaborative editing, webhook system for platform integrations, email/SMS APIs for form distribution, calendar APIs for deadline management, conflict resolution for simultaneous edits, audit logging for form changes and access.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```
