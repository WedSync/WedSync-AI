# TEAM E - ROUND 1: WS-286 - Advanced Form Builder
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Create comprehensive testing and documentation for advanced form builder with >95% coverage and wedding form validation
**FEATURE ID:** WS-286 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about form validation accuracy and comprehensive wedding form testing

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/__tests__/form-builder/advanced/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/__tests__/form-builder/advanced/FormBuilder.comprehensive.test.tsx | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test form-builder-advanced
# MUST show: "All tests passing with >95% coverage"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## 🧠 STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Comprehensive Form Builder Testing Strategy
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Advanced form builder testing requires: drag-drop functionality validation, wedding-specific field type verification, conditional logic accuracy testing, form template validation, mobile-responsive form testing, accessibility compliance verification, wedding data integration accuracy.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding form complexity testing: Forms with guest relationships (plus-one handling), dietary restriction validation, song request content filtering, vendor intake form business logic, timeline form date validation, RSVP form deadline enforcement, seating assignment form capacity checks.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Drag-drop interface testing: Element positioning accuracy, touch device support, keyboard accessibility, screen reader compatibility, mobile gesture recognition, field reordering validation, template loading and saving, collaborative editing conflict resolution.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Integration testing scenarios: Form data synchronization with wedding profiles, real-time collaborative editing with multiple users, conditional logic execution accuracy, template application and customization, mobile-desktop form consistency, offline form building capability.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Documentation requirements: Form builder user guides for couples and vendors, developer API documentation, wedding form template library documentation, accessibility compliance reports, performance optimization guides, troubleshooting documentation for form issues.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 5,
  totalThoughts: 5
});
```
