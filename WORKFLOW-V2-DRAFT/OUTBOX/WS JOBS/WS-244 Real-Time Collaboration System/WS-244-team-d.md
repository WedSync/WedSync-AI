**FEATURE ID:** WS-244 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about mobile collaborative editing UX, offline conflict resolution, and touch-optimized real-time interfaces

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/mobile/collaboration/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/mobile/collaboration/MobileCollaborativeEditor.tsx | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test mobile-collaboration
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## 📚 STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query existing mobile collaboration and offline patterns
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("mobile|collaboration|offline|touch|editor");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("MobileEditor", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/components/mobile");
```

### B. UI STYLE GUIDES & TECHNOLOGY STACK (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Load the correct UI Style Guide
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");
```

**🚨 CRITICAL MOBILE TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
- **React 19**: Mobile-optimized components with touch events
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.11**: Mobile-first responsive design
- **Y.js**: Offline-capable collaborative editing
- **Monaco Editor Mobile**: Touch-optimized code/text editing
- **PWA Features**: Service workers, offline document caching
- **Touch Optimization**: Gesture handling and haptic feedback

**❌ DO NOT USE:**

- Mouse-dependent selection and editing tools
- Fixed pixel dimensions (use responsive units)

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation SPECIFIC to mobile collaborative editing and Y.js mobile patterns
# Use Ref MCP to search for mobile collaborative editing, Y.js mobile usage, PWA collaboration, and touch-optimized editing
```

## 🧠 STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR MOBILE COLLABORATION

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Complex Analysis
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "I need to design mobile-first real-time collaboration that works perfectly on phones. Key mobile considerations: 1) Touch-friendly collaborative editing with proper gesture handling 2) Offline collaboration with local Y.js document storage 3) Conflict resolution when reconnecting from offline state 4) Mobile keyboard handling during collaborative editing 5) Touch selection and cursor positioning with real-time sync 6) Battery optimization for long collaborative sessions 7) Network-aware sync with cellular data conservation. The interface must feel responsive even on slow mobile connections.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5
