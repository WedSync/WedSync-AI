await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query existing collaboration and real-time patterns
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("collaboration|realtime|websocket|editor");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("RealtimeProvider", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/components/realtime");
```

### B. UI STYLE GUIDES & TECHNOLOGY STACK (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Load the correct UI Style Guide
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation SPECIFIC to real-time collaboration and operational transform
# Use Ref MCP to search for Y.js, operational transform, real-time editing, and collaborative UI patterns
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COLLABORATIVE EDITING

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Complex Analysis
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "I need to design a real-time collaborative editing system for wedding planning documents. Key considerations: 1) Operational Transform with Y.js for conflict resolution 2) Real-time presence indicators showing who's editing where 3) User avatars and cursors with smooth animations 4) Document versioning and change history 5) Collaborative comment system 6) Mobile-responsive editing interface 7) WebSocket connection management with reconnection logic. The system must handle multiple users editing simultaneously without conflicts.",
