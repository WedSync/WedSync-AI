## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/collaboration/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/collaboration/operational-transform.test.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test collaboration
# MUST show: "All tests passing with >90% coverage"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## 📚 STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query existing test patterns and collaboration testing
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("test|spec|collaboration|realtime");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("describe", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("tests");
```

### B. TESTING & DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS
```typescript
// Load testing and documentation standards
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");
```

**🚨 CRITICAL TESTING TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
- **Jest**: Primary testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing
- **Playwright**: End-to-end collaborative testing with visual validation
- **Y.js Testing Utils**: Operational transform testing
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: WebSocket mocking
- **jest-axe**: Accessibility testing for collaborative interfaces

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation SPECIFIC to collaborative testing and Y.js testing patterns
# Use Ref MCP to search for Y.js testing, operational transform testing, real-time testing strategies, and collaborative system quality assurance
```

## 🧠 STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPREHENSIVE COLLABORATIVE TESTING

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Testing Strategy
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "I need to design a comprehensive testing strategy for real-time collaborative editing. Key testing areas: 1) Operational Transform conflict resolution with multiple simultaneous edits 2) Y.js document synchronization across multiple clients 3) WebSocket connection handling with network failures 4) Real-time presence and cursor position accuracy 5) Offline collaboration with sync conflict resolution 6) Performance testing with 50+ concurrent collaborators 7) Mobile collaborative editing across devices 8) Security testing for collaborative session access 9) Load testing for document operations per second 10) End-to-end collaborative workflows. Each area needs specific test scenarios and automated validation.",
