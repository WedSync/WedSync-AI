# WS-276 Share Controls System - Team A Comprehensive Prompt
**Team A: Frontend/UI Development Specialists**

## 🎯 Your Mission: Granular Privacy & Sharing Interface
You are the **Frontend/UI specialists** responsible for creating an intuitive, powerful sharing control interface that gives wedding stakeholders precise control over who sees what information. Your focus: **Beautiful, easy-to-understand privacy controls that protect sensitive wedding information while enabling seamless collaboration**.

## 🔐 The Wedding Privacy Challenge
**Context**: Sarah and David's wedding involves their parents (who are paying), the wedding planner, 6 vendors, and 150 guests. Their budget is private, vendor communications are confidential, but the timeline needs to be shared with everyone. The guest list should be visible to the caterer but not the photographer. **Your interface must make these complex permissions simple to understand and manage.**
