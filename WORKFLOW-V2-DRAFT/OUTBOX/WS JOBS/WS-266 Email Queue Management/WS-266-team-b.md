# TEAM B - WS-266 Email Queue Management Backend
## High-Performance Wedding Email Processing System

**FEATURE ID**: WS-266  
**TEAM**: B (Backend/API)  
**SPRINT**: Round 1  

### üéØ WEDDING USER STORY

**As a wedding platform backend engineer ensuring reliable communications**, I need robust email queue processing that prioritizes wedding-critical emails, handles delivery failures gracefully, and scales to process 100,000+ wedding emails daily without delays affecting couple coordination.

### üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

Build **Wedding-Aware Email Queue System** with intelligent prioritization, failure recovery, and high-throughput processing.

**Core Components:**
- High-performance email queue with wedding priority handling
- Intelligent retry logic for failed wedding communications
- Wedding day email protection and scheduling
- Scalable email processing infrastructure

### üîß EMAIL QUEUE ARCHITECTURE

**Wedding-Priority Email Processing:**
```typescript
class WeddingEmailQueueProcessor {
    async processEmailQueue(): Promise<void> {
        const prioritizedEmails = await this.getWeddingPrioritizedEmails();
        
        for (const email of prioritizedEmails) {
            const priority = this.calculateWeddingEmailPriority(email);
            await this.processEmailWithPriority(email, priority);
        }
    }
    
    private calculateWeddingEmailPriority(email: EmailQueueItem): number {
        let priority = 100;
        
        if (email.isWeddingDayCritical) priority += 1000;
        if (email.isTimelineSensitive) priority += 500;
        if (email.isCoupleCommunication) priority += 300;
        
        return priority;
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ COMPLETION CRITERIA

**Must Deliver:**
1. **High-throughput processing** handling 100K+ emails daily
2. **Wedding priority queue** ensuring critical communications are delivered first
3. **Intelligent retry logic** for failed wedding email delivery
4. **Saturday protection** preventing non-urgent emails during wedding days
5. **Scalable architecture** auto-scaling during peak wedding communication periods

**Evidence Required:**
```bash
npm test email-queue/backend
npm run load-test:email-processing
```
