# TEAM D - WS-266 Email Queue Management Performance & Infrastructure
## High-Performance Email Processing Infrastructure

**FEATURE ID**: WS-266  
**TEAM**: D (Performance/Infrastructure)  
**SPRINT**: Round 1  

### üéØ WEDDING USER STORY

**As a wedding platform infrastructure engineer**, I need ultra-high-performance email queue infrastructure that can process 10,000+ wedding emails per minute with guaranteed delivery during peak wedding communication periods, ensuring no couple misses critical wedding day updates due to infrastructure limitations.

### üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

Build **High-Performance Email Infrastructure** with distributed processing, intelligent scaling, and wedding traffic optimization.

### ‚ö° HIGH-PERFORMANCE ARCHITECTURE

**Distributed Email Processing:**
```typescript
class HighPerformanceEmailProcessor {
    async processEmailBatch(emails: EmailBatch): Promise<ProcessingResult> {
        const workerPool = this.getOptimalWorkerPool();
        const batches = this.createOptimalBatches(emails);
        
        return await Promise.all(
            batches.map(batch => workerPool.process(batch))
        );
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ COMPLETION CRITERIA

**Must Deliver:**
1. **High-throughput processing** handling 10K+ emails per minute
2. **Distributed architecture** with auto-scaling capabilities
3. **Wedding traffic optimization** with priority processing
4. **Performance monitoring** ensuring sub-second processing times
5. **High-availability setup** with automatic failover

**Evidence Required:**
```bash
npm run load-test:email-infrastructure
```
