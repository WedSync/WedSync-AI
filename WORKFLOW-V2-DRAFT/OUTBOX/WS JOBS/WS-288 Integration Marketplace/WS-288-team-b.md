# TEAM B - ROUND 1: WS-288 - Integration Marketplace
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build secure integration API platform with webhook orchestration, OAuth2 management, and wedding data synchronization
**FEATURE ID:** WS-288 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about integration security, data mapping, and wedding workflow automation APIs

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/app/api/integrations/marketplace/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/app/api/integrations/marketplace/workflows/route.ts | head -20
```

## üß† SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Integration Marketplace API Architecture
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Integration marketplace API requires: Secure OAuth2 flow management, webhook orchestration and delivery, data transformation and mapping APIs, workflow execution engine, integration health monitoring, rate limiting per integration, audit logging for compliance, developer API documentation and SDKs.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding data synchronization APIs: Guest list sync with RSVP systems, vendor timeline integration, budget tracking with payment processors, photo/video workflow automation, communication template sync, calendar integration for scheduling, contract management integration, invoice processing automation.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Workflow automation engine: Trigger-based workflow execution, conditional logic processing, data transformation pipelines, error handling and retry mechanisms, workflow versioning and rollback, performance monitoring, batch processing capabilities, real-time execution tracking.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Integration security and compliance: OAuth2 token management with refresh, webhook signature verification, data encryption in transit and rest, GDPR compliance for data processing, audit trails for all integrations, rate limiting and DDoS protection, integration sandboxing for testing.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```
