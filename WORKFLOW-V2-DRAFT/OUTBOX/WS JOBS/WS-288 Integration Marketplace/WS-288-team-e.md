# TEAM E - ROUND 1: WS-288 - Integration Marketplace
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Create comprehensive integration testing and documentation with >95% coverage and wedding workflow validation
**FEATURE ID:** WS-288 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about integration reliability validation and comprehensive wedding workflow testing

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/__tests__/integrations/marketplace/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/__tests__/integrations/marketplace/IntegrationMarketplace.comprehensive.test.tsx | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test integration-marketplace
# MUST show: "All tests passing with >95% coverage"
```

## 🧠 SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Integration Marketplace Testing Strategy
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Integration marketplace testing requires: OAuth2 flow validation across multiple providers, webhook delivery reliability testing, data synchronization accuracy validation, workflow execution testing with error scenarios, integration health monitoring verification, rate limiting and security testing.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding integration scenarios: Photography CRM sync validation (Tave/Light Blue), calendar integration accuracy testing, guest list synchronization verification, vendor communication thread testing, timeline coordination across multiple systems, payment processing integration validation.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Integration reliability testing: Network failure simulation, API rate limiting scenarios, authentication token expiry handling, data consistency validation across systems, conflict resolution testing, integration performance under load, failover and recovery testing.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Workflow automation testing: Trigger-based workflow execution validation, conditional logic accuracy, data transformation verification, error handling and retry mechanisms, workflow versioning and rollback testing, performance monitoring validation, batch processing accuracy.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Documentation requirements: Integration developer guides, wedding workflow documentation, OAuth2 setup instructions, webhook configuration guides, troubleshooting documentation, partner onboarding materials, API reference documentation, security compliance guides.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 5,
  totalThoughts: 5
});
