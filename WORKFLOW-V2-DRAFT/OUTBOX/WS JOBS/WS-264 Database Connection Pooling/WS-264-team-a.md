# TEAM A - WS-264 Database Connection Pooling UI Dashboard
## Wedding Database Performance Monitoring & Pool Management

**FEATURE ID**: WS-264  
**TEAM**: A (Frontend/UI)  
**SPRINT**: Round 1  

### üéØ WEDDING USER STORY

**As a wedding platform database administrator monitoring 5000+ couples' data during peak season**, I need a real-time database connection pool dashboard that shows me exactly how many connections are being used by wedding coordinators, vendor integrations, and guest interactions, so I can ensure our database never becomes a bottleneck during critical Saturday wedding coordination when every database query could impact couples' special day.

**As a DevOps engineer responsible for wedding day stability**, I need visual indicators showing database connection health, pool utilization, and query performance with wedding-specific context, so I can proactively scale database resources before connection exhaustion affects live weddings.

### üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

Build a comprehensive **Database Connection Pool Dashboard** with real-time pool monitoring, wedding-aware connection visualization, and emergency pool management controls.

**Core Components:**
- Real-time connection pool status monitoring
- Wedding day connection usage analytics
- Database query performance visualization with wedding context
- Connection pool scaling controls for wedding traffic spikes
- Emergency connection management for Saturday wedding protection

### üé® UI REQUIREMENTS

**Dashboard Layout:**
- **Pool Status Header**: Current connections (active/idle/total) with wedding day indicators
- **Wedding Context Panel**: Active weddings and their database impact
- **Connection Analytics**: Real-time graphs showing pool utilization patterns
- **Query Performance**: Response times with wedding-critical query highlighting
- **Emergency Controls**: Pool scaling and connection management for wedding incidents

**Wedding-Specific Elements:**
- **Saturday Shield**: Visual indicator when wedding day pool protection is active
- **Active Wedding Load**: Real-time connection usage from active wedding operations
- **Vendor Connection Monitor**: Track API integration database connections
- **Emergency Pool Controls**: Increase pool size during wedding day incidents

### üìä WEDDING-AWARE VISUALIZATION

**Connection Pool Metrics:**
```typescript
const WeddingConnectionMetrics = {
    pool_utilization: "Real-time active/idle connection ratio",
    wedding_day_multiplier: "Enhanced pool size during Saturday weddings", 
    vendor_connection_tracking: "API integration connection usage",
    guest_interaction_load: "RSVP and guest portal database connections",
    emergency_pool_status: "Available emergency connections for wedding incidents"
};
```

**Performance Indicators:**
- **Green**: <50% pool utilization, <100ms query times
- **Yellow**: 50-80% utilization, 100-500ms queries
- **Red**: >80% utilization, >500ms queries (wedding impact risk)

### ‚úÖ COMPLETION CRITERIA

**Must Deliver:**
1. **Real-time pool monitoring** with wedding context awareness
2. **Wedding day visualization** showing Saturday protection status
3. **Mobile responsive design** for emergency venue access
4. **Emergency pool controls** with proper authentication
5. **Query performance tracking** highlighting wedding-critical operations

**Evidence Required:**
```bash
ls -la /wedsync/src/components/database-pooling/
npm run typecheck && npm test database-pooling/ui
```
