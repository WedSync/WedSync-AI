## 🧠 STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Mobile-First Analytics Strategy
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Mobile wedding analytics needs: quick progress glances while venue shopping, budget checks during vendor meetings, guest response tracking on-the-go, milestone celebrations with haptic feedback, offline analytics for poor venue connectivity, partner sync for collaborative planning.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "WedMe analytics context: Couples check progress frequently during busy wedding planning, need simplified mobile views focused on next actions, want celebration moments for motivation, require offline access during venue visits, need partner coordination features for shared decision-making.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Mobile analytics optimization: Touch-friendly charts with gesture interactions, simplified data visualization for small screens, progressive disclosure for detailed metrics, swipe navigation between analytics sections, pull-to-refresh for latest updates, optimized data transfer for mobile bandwidth.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Offline analytics requirements: Cache key metrics for offline viewing, store recent progress updates, enable offline milestone celebrations, sync analytics changes when connection restored, preserve user interactions during offline periods, graceful degradation for missing data.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "WedMe integration architecture: Simplified mobile analytics API, optimized chart components for touch, PWA-enabled analytics with caching, partner collaboration features, push notifications for milestone achievements, integration with wedding day countdown and preparation features.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 5,
  totalThoughts: 5
});
```
