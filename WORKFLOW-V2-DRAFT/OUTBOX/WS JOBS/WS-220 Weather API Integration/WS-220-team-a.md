## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/weather/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/weather/WeatherDashboard.tsx | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**

# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test weather
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## üìö STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query weather-related patterns
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("weather forecast api integration");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("WeatherComponent Dashboard", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/");
```

### B. UI STYLE GUIDES & TECHNOLOGY STACK (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Load the correct UI Style Guide
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");
```

**üö® CRITICAL UI TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
- **Untitled UI**: Primary component library (MANDATORY)
- **Magic UI**: Animations and visual enhancements (MANDATORY)
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.11**: Utility-first CSS
- **Lucide React**: Icons ONLY

**‚ùå DO NOT USE:**
- Radix UI, Catalyst UI, shadcn/ui, or any other component libraries

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
# Use Ref MCP to search for:
# - "Next.js server-components weather-api"
# - "React hooks weather-data state-management"
# - "Tailwind CSS responsive-design dashboard-layout"
# - "TypeScript interfaces weather-api types"
```

### D. ANALYZE EXISTING PATTERNS (MINUTES 5-10)
```typescript
// Use Serena to understand existing dashboard patterns
await mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols("Dashboard Card Component");
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("useEffect useState weather");
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Weather Dashboard UI Architecture Analysis
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Weather dashboard for wedding planning needs: real-time weather display, 15-day forecast with wedding date highlighting, severe weather alerts, mobile-responsive design for on-site coordination, integration with wedding timeline components. Each component requires different data visualization and interaction patterns.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "State management analysis: Weather data needs periodic refresh (every 30 minutes), forecast data requires caching for performance, severe weather alerts need real-time notifications, wedding date context affects forecast highlighting. Consider React Query for server state, Zustand for UI state management.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Component architecture: WeatherDashboard (main container), WeatherCard (current conditions), ForecastTimeline (15-day view), WeatherAlerts (notification system), MobileWeatherWidget (compact view). Each needs proper TypeScript interfaces and loading states.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding UX considerations: Outdoor wedding planners need quick weather assessment, photographers need lighting condition info, couples need temperature guidance for attire. Interface must work on mobile during venue visits, provide actionable insights, and integrate seamlessly with existing wedding planning workflow.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

**Real Wedding Scenario:** A couple has booked an outdoor garden wedding for next Saturday at 4pm in Napa Valley. The wedding planner uses weather integration to see a 15-day forecast showing 40% chance of rain that day with temperatures dropping to 55¬∞F by evening. They proactively arrange tent rentals, notify the couple about potential attire changes, and alert the photographer about indoor lighting equipment.
