# TEAM C - ROUND 1: WS-280 - Thank You Management System
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build integration systems for thank you management with external services and real-time features
**FEATURE ID:** WS-280 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about email notifications, address verification, and reminder automations

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/integrations/thank-you/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/integrations/thank-you/notification-service.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test integrations/thank-you
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## üìö STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query integration patterns and notification systems
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("notification email integration webhook realtime");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("NotificationService EmailService Integration", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/lib/integrations/");
```

### B. INTEGRATION PATTERNS (MANDATORY FOR ALL INTEGRATION WORK)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Load existing integration patterns
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/integrations/email-service.ts");
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("webhook subscription realtime supabase");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("RealtimeProvider SupabaseClient", "", true);
```

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation SPECIFIC to integrations
# Use Ref MCP to search for:
# - "Supabase realtime subscriptions broadcast"
# - "Resend email templates transactional"
# - "Next.js webhook handling validation"
# - "Address validation APIs integration"
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Integration Design
```typescript
// Use for complex integration planning
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Thank you system integrations needed: Email reminders for overdue thank yous, address validation service integration, real-time progress updates between couple members, calendar integration for thank you deadlines, photo storage integration, postal service tracking APIs.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Integration complexity analysis: Email reminders need personalization and scheduling, address validation prevents bounced mail, real-time updates require WebSocket connections, calendar integration helps with deadline management, photo uploads need secure processing pipeline.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Failure scenarios: Email service rate limits during batch sending, address validation API downtime, real-time connection drops during updates, calendar sync conflicts, photo upload failures. Need circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, and graceful fallbacks.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Implementation strategy: Event-driven architecture for thank you milestones, webhook handling for external service updates, real-time subscriptions for progress sync, background job processing for batch operations, integration health monitoring.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

## üöÄ STEP 2B: LAUNCH ENHANCED AGENTS WITH SPECIFIC MISSIONS

Launch these agents with comprehensive requirements:

1. **task-tracker-coordinator** - Track integration dependencies and API connections
2. **integration-specialist** - Build service integrations and webhook handling  
3. **security-compliance-officer** - Secure API keys and webhook validation
4. **code-quality-guardian** - Integration patterns and error handling consistency
5. **test-automation-architect** - Integration testing with mock services
6. **documentation-chronicler** - Integration documentation with failure scenarios

## üîí SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE!)

### INTEGRATION SECURITY CHECKLIST:
- [ ] **API key management** - Secure storage and rotation of external API keys
- [ ] **Webhook validation** - Verify webhook signatures and sources
- [ ] **Rate limiting** - Prevent abuse of notification systems
- [ ] **Data privacy** - PII protection in external service calls
- [ ] **Error handling** - No sensitive data leaked in integration errors
- [ ] **Audit logging** - Log all external service interactions

## üéØ TEAM C SPECIALIZATION: INTEGRATION FOCUS

**INTEGRATION FOCUS:**
- Third-party service integration

export class ThankYouNotificationService {
  async sendOverdueReminder(weddingId: string, overdueGuests: Guest[]) {
    // Batch email sending with rate limiting
    // Personalized content based on gift details
    // Integration with Resend email service

```typescript
// Integration with address validation service
export class AddressVerificationService {
  async validateGuestAddresses(guests: Guest[]) {

  async subscribeToProgress(weddingId: string, callback: (update: ProgressUpdate) => void) {
    // Supabase realtime subscription
    // Progress updates between couple members

  }
  
  async broadcastProgressUpdate(weddingId: string, update: ProgressUpdate) {
    // Broadcast progress changes
    // Update all connected clients
