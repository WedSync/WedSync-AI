# WS-259: Monitoring Setup Implementation System - Team A (React Component Development)

## üéØ Team A Focus: React Component Development & Dashboard Interface

### üìã Your Assignment
Build comprehensive React dashboard and monitoring interface components for the Monitoring Setup Implementation System, providing wedding suppliers and platform administrators with real-time visibility into system health, performance metrics, business analytics, and incident management to ensure 99.9% uptime and optimal user experience.

### üé™ Wedding Industry Context
Wedding suppliers depend on WedSync being available 24/7, especially during peak wedding seasons when every minute of downtime could mean missing critical client communications, losing bookings, or failing to capture important wedding day moments. The monitoring dashboard must provide instant visibility into system health with wedding-specific context - understanding that Saturday outages are catastrophic, peak wedding season requires different alerting thresholds, and wedding day incidents need immediate escalation to prevent disrupting once-in-a-lifetime celebrations.

### üéØ Specific Requirements

   - Real-time system status with traffic light indicators (green/yellow/red)
   - Wedding-context aware status (weekend vs weekday, wedding season indicators)
   - API endpoint health monitoring with response time visualization
   - Database performance metrics with query optimization insights
   - Third-party integration status (Stripe, email, SMS, CRM integrations)

2. **Performance Monitoring Interface**
   - Core Web Vitals dashboard with mobile/desktop breakdowns
   - API response time analytics with percentile distributions
   - Database query performance with slow query identification
   - User journey performance tracking across critical workflows

   - Wedding season performance analytics

4. **Error Tracking & Incident Management**
   - Real-time error stream with intelligent grouping
   - Incident escalation workflow with wedding-day priority
   - Error correlation visualization across services
   - Auto-recovery monitoring with failure pattern analysis
   - Post-incident analysis dashboard with actionable insights

5. **Alert Configuration & Management**
   - Intelligent alert routing with context-aware notifications
