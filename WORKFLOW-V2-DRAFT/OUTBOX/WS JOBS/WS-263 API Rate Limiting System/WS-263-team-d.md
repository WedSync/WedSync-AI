# TEAM D - WS-263 API Rate Limiting System Performance & Infrastructure
## High-Performance Rate Limiting & Wedding Traffic Scaling

**FEATURE ID**: WS-263  
**TEAM**: D (Performance/Infrastructure)  
**SPRINT**: Round 1  

### 🎯 WEDDING USER STORY

**As a wedding platform infrastructure engineer**, I need ultra-high-performance rate limiting infrastructure that can process 100,000+ API requests per second with <1ms latency overhead, so our rate limiting never becomes the bottleneck during Saturday wedding traffic spikes when every millisecond delay could impact couples' coordination.

### 🏗️ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

Build **High-Performance Rate Limiting Infrastructure** with distributed rate limiting, intelligent caching, and wedding traffic auto-scaling.

**Core Performance Focus:**
- Distributed rate limiting with Redis cluster
- Sub-millisecond rate limit checking
- Wedding traffic prediction and preemptive scaling
- Intelligent caching for tier limits and usage patterns

### ⚡ HIGH-PERFORMANCE ARCHITECTURE

**Ultra-Fast Rate Limiting:**
```typescript
class HighPerformanceRateLimiter {
    private redisCluster: RedisCluster;
    private localCache: LRUCache;
    
    async checkRateLimit(key: string, limit: number, windowMs: number): Promise<RateLimitResult> {
        // Try local cache first for ultra-low latency
        const cached = this.localCache.get(key);
        if (cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < 1000) { // 1s cache
            return this.calculateFromCache(cached, limit);
        }
        
        // Distributed rate limiting with pipeline for performance
        const pipeline = this.redisCluster.pipeline();
        pipeline.incr(key);
        pipeline.expire(key, Math.ceil(windowMs / 1000));
        
        const results = await pipeline.exec();
        const currentCount = results[0][1] as number;
        
        return {
            allowed: currentCount <= limit,
            remainingQuota: Math.max(0, limit - currentCount),
            retryAfter: currentCount > limit ? windowMs : 0
        };
    }
}
```

### ✅ COMPLETION CRITERIA

**Must Deliver:**
1. **Sub-millisecond rate limiting** with <1ms processing overhead
2. **Distributed architecture** scaling to 100K+ requests/second
3. **Wedding traffic auto-scaling** based on prediction algorithms
4. **High-availability setup** with Redis clustering
5. **Performance monitoring** with real-time metrics

**Evidence Required:**
```bash
npm run load-test:rate-limiting
# Must show: "100K+ req/s with <1ms latency"
```
