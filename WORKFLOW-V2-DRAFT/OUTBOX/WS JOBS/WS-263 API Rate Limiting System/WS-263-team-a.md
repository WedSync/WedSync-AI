# TEAM A - WS-263 API Rate Limiting System UI Dashboard
## Wedding-Aware Traffic Control & Fair Usage Monitoring

**FEATURE ID**: WS-263  
**TEAM**: A (Frontend/UI)  
**SPRINT**: Round 1  

### 🎯 WEDDING USER STORY

**As a wedding platform operations manager monitoring 5000+ couples during peak season**, I need a real-time API rate limiting dashboard that shows me exactly which vendors, couples, and integrations are consuming API quotas, so I can ensure fair usage while protecting our platform from being overwhelmed during critical Saturday wedding coordination when every API call could impact a couple's special day.

**As a wedding vendor who's been rate limited during urgent wedding day coordination**, I need a clear, mobile-friendly interface that shows me my current API usage, remaining quota, and exactly when my access will be restored, so I can plan my wedding day activities and communicate accurate timelines to couples without causing stress.

### 🏗️ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

### 📊 WEDDING CONTEXT & BUSINESS LOGIC

**Wedding Day API Protection:**
- Automatically increase rate limits for active wedding vendors by 2x
- Show "Wedding Day Protection Active" banner on Saturdays
- Display current active weddings and their API consumption impact
- Provide emergency override controls for wedding day incidents

**Tier-Based API Quota Visualization:**
```typescript
const API_TIER_LIMITS = {
    FREE: {
        requests_per_hour: 100,
        burst_limit: 10,
        wedding_day_boost: '1.5x', // 50% increase on wedding days
        color_theme: 'gray'
    },
    STARTER: {
        requests_per_hour: 1000,
        burst_limit: 50,
        wedding_day_boost: '2x', // Double on wedding days
        color_theme: 'blue'
    },
    PROFESSIONAL: {
        requests_per_hour: 5000,
        burst_limit: 200,
        wedding_day_boost: '3x', // Triple for premium users
        color_theme: 'purple'
    },
    SCALE: {
        requests_per_hour: 20000,
        burst_limit: 500,
        wedding_day_boost: '5x',
        color_theme: 'orange'
    },
    ENTERPRISE: {
        requests_per_hour: 100000,
        burst_limit: 2000,
        wedding_day_boost: 'unlimited',
        color_theme: 'gold'
    }
};
```

**Wedding Traffic Pattern Recognition:**
```typescript
const WEDDING_TRAFFIC_PATTERNS = {
    GUEST_RSVP_SURGE: {
        typical_time: '6-8 PM weekday evenings',
        api_endpoints: ['/api/rsvp/submit', '/api/guest/details'],
        expected_multiplier: '3x normal traffic',
        auto_scaling_trigger: 'enabled'
    },
    VENDOR_COORDINATION_RUSH: {
        typical_time: '2-4 PM day before wedding',
        api_endpoints: ['/api/vendor/status', '/api/timeline/update'],
        expected_multiplier: '5x normal traffic',
        priority_handling: 'wedding_day_priority_queue'
    },
    PHOTO_UPLOAD_STORM: {
        typical_time: 'During and after wedding ceremonies',
        api_endpoints: ['/api/photos/upload', '/api/albums/create'],
        expected_multiplier: '10x normal traffic',
        temporary_limit_increase: 'automatic'
    }
};
```

### 📱 MOBILE EMERGENCY INTERFACE

**Wedding Day Mobile Controls:**
```typescript
const MobileEmergencyInterface = {
    // Large touch targets for wedding day stress
    emergency_controls: {
        increase_vendor_limits: '60px height button',
        platform_traffic_status: 'Full-screen status dashboard',
        active_wedding_monitoring: 'Swipe navigation between weddings',
        rate_limit_overrides: 'Emergency override with authentication'
    },
    
    // Critical information display
    wedding_day_metrics: {
        current_active_weddings: 'Count with visual indicator',
        platform_health_status: 'Green/yellow/red status indicator',
        critical_api_bottlenecks: 'Alert cards with affected weddings',
        vendor_rate_limit_violations: 'List with wedding day context'
    },
    
    // Emergency actions
    crisis_response: {
        platform_wide_rate_increase: 'Temporary boost for all users',
        wedding_specific_overrides: 'Per-wedding limit adjustments',
        vendor_priority_queue: 'Emergency vendor API prioritization',
