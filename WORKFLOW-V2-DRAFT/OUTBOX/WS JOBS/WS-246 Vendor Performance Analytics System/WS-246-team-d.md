npm test mobile-analytics
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## 🧠 SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR MOBILE ANALYTICS

### Mobile-Specific Sequential Thinking Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Mobile Analytics UX Analysis
```typescript
// Before building mobile analytics interface
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Mobile analytics for wedding vendors needs: thumb-friendly chart interactions, quick vendor performance overview, offline data caching for venue visits, swipe navigation between vendors, and portrait-oriented dashboard layout. Screen real estate is limited but information density is critical.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Touch interaction analysis: Charts need pinch-to-zoom, vendor cards need swipe-to-compare, filters need touch-friendly dropdowns, and data refresh needs pull-to-refresh. Consider gesture conflicts and provide visual feedback for all interactions.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Mobile performance considerations: Analytics data is heavy, charts can be CPU intensive, and network connections vary. Need progressive loading, chart virtualization, smart caching, and graceful degradation for slow connections.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding vendor mobile context: Planners check vendor performance during client meetings, at venues, and while traveling. Need quick loading, clear visual hierarchies, essential metrics prioritized, and ability to share insights easily.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

## 📚 ENHANCED SERENA + REF SETUP (Mobile Focus)

### A. SERENA MOBILE PATTERN DISCOVERY
```typescript
// Find existing mobile patterns to follow
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("mobile responsive touch interaction");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("Mobile Touch Responsive", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/mobile/");

// Analyze mobile-specific implementations
await mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols("touchstart touchend swipe gesture");
```

### B. MOBILE DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENTATION
```typescript
// Load mobile development patterns
# Use Ref MCP to search for:
# - "React Native Web mobile patterns"
# - "Touch gesture handling React"
# - "Mobile analytics chart libraries"
# - "PWA offline caching strategies"
```
