# TEAM C - ROUND 1: WS-246 - Vendor Performance Analytics System
## 2025-09-03 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Implement vendor data integration and external analytics service connections for comprehensive performance tracking
**FEATURE ID:** WS-246 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about multi-source data integration, vendor system connections, and real-time data synchronization

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/integrations/analytics/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/integrations/analytics/VendorDataIntegration.ts | head-20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test analytics-integrations
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## 🧠 SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR INTEGRATION ANALYSIS

### Integration-Specific Sequential Thinking Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Multi-Source Data Integration Analysis
```typescript
// Before building integration system
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This analytics integration needs: vendor CRM data import, booking system integration, customer feedback collection, external benchmark data sources, and real-time synchronization. Each data source has different formats, authentication methods, and rate limits.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Data source analysis: Tave/Light Blue for booking data, customer review platforms for satisfaction scores, payment processors for transaction success rates, calendar systems for response times. Need data transformation pipelines and error handling for each source.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Integration reliability concerns: Wedding vendors can't afford data loss or incorrect analytics. Need retry mechanisms, data validation, conflict resolution, and fallback data sources. Consider queue-based processing for heavy data imports.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding industry integration specifics: Vendor data includes seasonal patterns, wedding day criticality flags, client satisfaction tied to wedding success, response times during peak seasons. Integration should preserve wedding context and timing importance.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

## 📚 ENHANCED SERENA + REF SETUP (Integration Focus)

### A. SERENA INTEGRATION PATTERN DISCOVERY
```typescript
// Find existing integration patterns to follow
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("integration connector webhook api sync");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("Integration Connector Webhook", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/integrations/");

// Analyze similar integrations for consistency
await mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols("fetch axios webhook queue");
```

### B. INTEGRATION DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENTATION
```typescript
// Load integration patterns
# Use Ref MCP to search for:
# - "API integration patterns webhook handling"
# - "Data synchronization strategies"
# - "Error handling retry mechanisms"
# - "Authentication OAuth API keys"
```

## 🔒 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE!)
