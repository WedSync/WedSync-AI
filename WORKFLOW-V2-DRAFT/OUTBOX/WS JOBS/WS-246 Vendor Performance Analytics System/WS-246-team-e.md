# TEAM E - ROUND 1: WS-246 - Vendor Performance Analytics System
## 2025-09-03 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Create comprehensive testing strategy and documentation for vendor performance analytics with accuracy validation
**FEATURE ID:** WS-246 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about analytics accuracy testing, performance validation, and comprehensive documentation

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **TEST SUITE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/analytics/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/analytics/analytics-accuracy.test.ts | head-20
```

2. **TEST EXECUTION RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern=analytics
# MUST show: "All tests passing" with >90% coverage
```

3. **DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/docs/analytics/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/docs/analytics/WS-246-analytics-guide.md | head-20
```

## 🧠 SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR ANALYTICS TESTING

### QA-Specific Sequential Thinking Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Analytics Testing Strategy Analysis
```typescript
// Before building testing strategy
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Analytics testing requires: calculation accuracy validation, data visualization correctness, performance benchmarking under load, mobile responsiveness across devices, and integration testing with multiple data sources. Each layer needs different testing approaches.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Testing data accuracy: Vendor scoring algorithms need mathematical validation, benchmark comparisons require known datasets, real-time updates need sync verification, and historical data trends need consistency checks. Consider edge cases like data conflicts and missing metrics.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Performance testing requirements: Analytics dashboard must load <2s, charts must render at 60fps, API responses <200ms, mobile interactions <100ms. Need load testing for concurrent users, memory leak testing, and battery usage validation.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding industry testing context: Vendor analytics affect business decisions, incorrect data could harm vendor relationships, peak wedding season creates high loads, mobile usage during venue visits is critical. Testing must ensure reliability for wedding-critical decisions.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

## 📚 ENHANCED SERENA + REF SETUP (QA Focus)

### A. SERENA TESTING PATTERN DISCOVERY
```typescript
// Find existing testing patterns to follow
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("test spec describe expect mock");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("test describe expect", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/");

// Analyze testing strategies for consistency
await mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols("render screen fireEvent waitFor");
```

### B. TESTING DOCUMENTATION
```typescript
// Load testing frameworks and patterns
# Use Ref MCP to search for:
# - "Jest React Testing Library patterns"
# - "Playwright E2E testing analytics"
# - "Performance testing strategies"
# - "API testing validation patterns"
```
