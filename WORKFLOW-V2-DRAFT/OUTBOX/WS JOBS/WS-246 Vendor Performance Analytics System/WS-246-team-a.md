# TEAM A - ROUND 1: WS-246 - Vendor Performance Analytics System
## 2025-09-03 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Create interactive analytics dashboard with charts and KPI visualization for vendor performance tracking
**FEATURE ID:** WS-246 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about mobile-friendly analytics visualization and real-time performance data

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/analytics
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/analytics/VendorAnalyticsDashboard.tsx | head-20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test vendor-analytics
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## üß† SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR UI DEVELOPMENT

### Frontend-Specific Sequential Thinking Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Complex UI Architecture Analysis
```typescript
// Before building complex UI components
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This vendor performance analytics UI needs: interactive charts with filtering, vendor scorecards with color-coded metrics, benchmarking comparison tools, mobile-responsive layout for on-the-go access, and real-time data updates. Each component has different visualization patterns and state management needs.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Analytics state management analysis: Chart data needs caching for performance, filtering requires URL-synced state, comparison tools need multi-vendor selection, real-time updates require WebSocket integration. Consider using TanStack Query for server state, Zustand for UI state.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Component architecture: AnalyticsDashboard (main container), PerformanceCharts (chart library wrapper), VendorScoreCard (metric display), BenchmarkingInterface (comparison tools), FilterPanel (data filtering). Each needs proper TypeScript interfaces and loading states.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding industry analytics considerations: Planners need quick vendor performance insights during busy season, charts should highlight critical metrics like response time and booking success rate, mobile access is essential for on-site decisions. Need touch-friendly interactions and offline capability.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

## üìö ENHANCED SERENA + REF SETUP (Frontend Focus)

### A. SERENA UI PATTERN DISCOVERY
```typescript
// Find existing UI patterns to follow
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("dashboard analytics chart visualization");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("Dashboard Chart Analytics", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/ui/");

// Analyze similar features for consistency
await mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols("useQuery useState useEffect");
```

### B. UI STYLE GUIDES & UNTITLED UI/MAGIC UI SETUP
```typescript
// MANDATORY FIRST - Load correct UI Style Guide
// For general SaaS features:
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// Load Untitled UI and Magic UI documentation
# Use Ref MCP to search for:
# - "Untitled UI components patterns charts analytics"
# - "Magic UI animations effects transitions dashboard"

// Then load supporting documentation
# Use Ref MCP to search for:
# - "Next.js app-router components dashboard"
# - "Tailwind CSS responsive-design analytics"
# - "React Hook Form validation analytics"
```

**üé® UI IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- **MUST use Untitled UI components** - No custom components unless extending Untitled UI
- **MUST use Magic UI for animations** - No custom animations
- **Analytics Dashboard UI**: Professional dashboard with data visualization
- **Performance Charts**: Interactive charts with filtering and drill-down

## üé® UI IMPLEMENTATION RULES (WITH SERENA VALIDATION)
- [ ] MUST use existing components from $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/ui/ (Serena: find_symbol)
- [ ] MUST follow color system - NO hardcoded hex colors (Serena: verify patterns)
- [ ] MUST test at 375px, 768px, 1920px breakpoints (Playwright: resize & snapshot)
- [ ] MUST maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratios (Playwright: accessibility check)
- [ ] MUST support dark mode (Serena: find existing dark mode patterns)

## üîí SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE!)

### COMPONENT SECURITY CHECKLIST:
- [ ] **Data sanitization** - All vendor data must be sanitized before display
- [ ] **XSS prevention** - No dangerouslySetInnerHTML without validation
- [ ] **Access control** - Vendor data visibility based on user permissions
- [ ] **API key protection** - No API keys in client-side code
- [ ] **Data masking** - Sensitive vendor information properly masked
- [ ] **Error boundaries** - Graceful handling of analytics failures
- [ ] **Input validation** - All filter inputs validated client-side
- [ ] **Audit logging** - Log analytics access for compliance

## üß≠ NAVIGATION INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY FOR UI FEATURES)

**‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Creating standalone pages without navigation integration**
**‚úÖ MANDATORY: All dashboards, pages, and components must connect to parent navigation**

### NAVIGATION INTEGRATION CHECKLIST
- [ ] Desktop navigation link added to main dashboard
- [ ] Mobile navigation support verified  
- [ ] Navigation states (active/current) implemented
- [ ] Breadcrumbs updated for analytics section
- [ ] Accessibility labels for navigation items

```typescript
// File: $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx
// Add navigation item:
{
  title: "Vendor Analytics",
  href: "/dashboard/analytics",
  icon: BarChart3
}
```
