# TEAM A - WS-261 Load Testing Framework UI Dashboard
## Wedding Day Performance Dashboard

**FEATURE ID**: WS-261  
**TEAM**: A (Frontend/UI)  
**SPRINT**: Round 1  

### üéØ WEDDING USER STORY

**As a wedding coordinator managing 5 simultaneous weddings on Saturday evening**, I need a real-time performance dashboard that shows me how our platform is handling the guest rush when 500+ wedding guests are all trying to RSVP, view details, and upload photos at the same time, so I can quickly identify and resolve any slowdowns that might impact couples' special day.

**As a DevOps engineer monitoring wedding season traffic**, I need visual indicators showing response times, throughput, and error rates with wedding-specific context (guest check-ins, photo uploads, vendor updates) so I can ensure every couple's wedding day runs smoothly without technical delays.

### üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

Build a comprehensive **Load Testing Dashboard** with real-time metrics visualization, specifically designed for wedding traffic patterns.

**Core Components Needed:**
- Real-time performance metrics display (response times, throughput, error rates)
- Wedding-specific load test scenarios (guest rush, photo upload spikes, vendor coordination)
- Test execution controls with wedding day protection (no tests on Saturdays)
- Historical performance analysis with wedding season trends
- Mobile-responsive design for emergency monitoring at wedding venues

### üé® UI REQUIREMENTS

**Dashboard Layout:**
- **Header**: Current system status with wedding-safe indicator
- **Metrics Cards**: Key performance indicators with color-coded alerts
- **Charts Section**: Real-time performance graphs with wedding event overlays
- **Test Controls**: Start/stop/schedule test buttons with Saturday blocking
- **Historical View**: Performance trends during wedding season peaks

**Wedding-Specific UI Elements:**
- **Wedding Day Shield**: Visual indicator when Saturday protection is active
- **Guest Rush Simulator**: Pre-configured test for 500 simultaneous guest actions
- **Photo Upload Stress Test**: Bulk photo upload performance testing
- **Vendor Coordination Load**: Multi-supplier simultaneous updates testing

### üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

**React Components to Build:**
```typescript
- LoadTestDashboard.tsx (main container)
- MetricsOverview.tsx (KPI cards with wedding context)
- PerformanceCharts.tsx (real-time graphs)
- TestControls.tsx (test execution with wedding protection)
- WeddingScenarios.tsx (pre-built test scenarios)
- HistoricalAnalysis.tsx (wedding season performance trends)
```

**Key Features:**
- WebSocket integration for real-time metrics updates
- Responsive design for mobile monitoring at venues
- Color-coded performance indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Wedding day protection UI (disable controls on Saturdays)
- Accessibility features for emergency use

### üìä WEDDING CONTEXT & BUSINESS LOGIC

**Saturday Wedding Protection:**
- Automatically disable all load testing on Saturdays
- Show "Wedding Day Protection Active" banner
- Provide estimated next available test slot

**Wedding Traffic Patterns:**
- **Guest Rush Hours**: 6-8 PM typical RSVP spikes
- **Photo Upload Surges**: During/after ceremonies
- **Vendor Check-ins**: 2-4 PM setup coordination
- **Family Communications**: Day-of timeline updates

**Performance Thresholds (Wedding-Critical):**
- Guest actions: <2 seconds response time
- Photo uploads: <5 seconds for 2MB images  
- Vendor updates: <1 second for status changes
- Timeline updates: <500ms for real-time sync

### ‚úÖ COMPLETION CRITERIA

**Must Deliver:**
1. **Working Dashboard** with real-time metrics display
2. **Wedding Scenarios** pre-configured for common traffic patterns
3. **Mobile Responsive** design tested on actual mobile devices
4. **Saturday Protection** preventing accidental weekend testing
5. **Performance Tests** showing <2s load times on 3G networks

**Evidence Required:**
```bash
# Prove your work exists:
ls -la /wedsync/src/components/load-testing/
cat /wedsync/src/components/load-testing/LoadTestDashboard.tsx | head -20

# Prove it compiles:
npm run typecheck
# Must show: "No errors found"

# Prove it works:
npm test load-testing
# Must show: "All tests passing"
```

**Wedding Integration Test:**
- Dashboard loads within 2 seconds on mobile
- Saturday protection blocks test execution properly
- Wedding scenarios execute without system impact
- Real-time updates work during simulated guest rush
- Emergency mobile access functions at wedding venues

### üö® WEDDING DAY CONSIDERATIONS

**Critical Requirements:**
- **Never test on Saturdays** - peak wedding day
- **Mobile-first design** - coordinators use phones at venues
- **Poor WiFi resilience** - many venues have weak connectivity
- **Emergency access** - must work during wedding day crises
- **Guest data protection** - never use real guest data in testing

**Success Metrics:**
- Dashboard responds in <2 seconds on 3G
- All wedding scenarios complete without platform impact
- Saturday protection prevents any weekend testing
- Mobile interface supports touch navigation at venues
- Real-time metrics update smoothly during high load

### üíº BUSINESS IMPACT

This load testing dashboard ensures our wedding platform can handle:
- **Saturday evening traffic spikes** when hundreds of guests interact simultaneously
- **Wedding photo sharing** without slowdowns during emotional moments
- **Vendor coordination rushes** during setup and breakdown
- **Family communication surges** when timeline updates are sent
- **Emergency scaling** when unexpected traffic occurs during weddings

**Revenue Protection:** Prevents wedding day technical failures that could damage our reputation and lose couples' trust in our platform during their most important day.
