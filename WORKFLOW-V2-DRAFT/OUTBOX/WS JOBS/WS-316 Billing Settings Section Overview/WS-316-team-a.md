## 💰 REAL WEDDING SCENARIO
**User Story:** "As Emma, a wedding photographer growing her business, I want to monitor my WedSync usage and see when I'm approaching my plan limits. I need to easily upgrade my subscription during busy wedding season without service interruption. I also want to view my billing history for tax purposes and update my payment method when my card expires."

## 🎨 BILLING DASHBOARD DESIGN

### Subscription Status Display
```typescript
interface SubscriptionStatus {
  currentTier: 'FREE' | 'STARTER' | 'PROFESSIONAL' | 'SCALE' | 'ENTERPRISE';
  billingCycle: 'monthly' | 'yearly';
  nextBillingDate: Date;
  currentPeriodEnd: Date;
  status: 'active' | 'past_due' | 'canceled' | 'trialing';
  trialEndsAt?: Date;
}
```

### Usage Monitoring Components
```typescript
interface UsageMetrics {
  clients: { used: number; limit: number; unlimited: boolean };
  forms: { used: number; limit: number; unlimited: boolean };
  emails: { used: number; limit: number; unlimited: boolean };
  storage: { used: number; limit: number; unlimited: boolean; unit: 'MB' | 'GB' };
  logins: { used: number; limit: number; unlimited: boolean };
}
```

### Plan Comparison Interface
```typescript
interface PlanFeature {
  name: string;
  tiers: {
    FREE: boolean | string | number;
    STARTER: boolean | string | number;
    PROFESSIONAL: boolean | string | number;
    SCALE: boolean | string | number;
    ENTERPRISE: boolean | string | number;
  };
  highlight?: boolean;
}
```
