**WEDDING CONTEXT REMINDER:** Your backend analytics system enables WedSync to continuously improve the mobile experience for wedding photographers - by analyzing how photographers interact with shot lists during ceremonies (while maintaining complete privacy), the system learns that larger touch targets are needed for timeline adjustments and that haptic feedback helps confirm actions when photographers can't look at their screen, automatically optimizing the interface to reduce missed shots and improve the couple's wedding day coverage.
