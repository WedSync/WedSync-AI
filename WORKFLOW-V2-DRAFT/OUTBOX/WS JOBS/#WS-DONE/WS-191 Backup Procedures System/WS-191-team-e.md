# TEAM E - ROUND 1: WS-191 - Backup Procedures System
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Create comprehensive testing strategy, user documentation, and quality assurance validation for wedding data backup system
**FEATURE ID:** WS-191 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about disaster recovery testing, backup integrity validation, and comprehensive documentation for critical system operations

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/backup/
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/docs/admin/backup-procedures/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/backup/backup-integration.test.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test backup
# MUST show: "All tests passing with >90% coverage"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## 📚 STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query existing test patterns and documentation structure
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("test spec documentation integration");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("test describe it expect", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/");
```

### B. TESTING PATTERNS ANALYSIS
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Understand existing testing frameworks and patterns
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("jest playwright vitest testing");
await mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols("describe beforeEach afterEach");
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/");
```

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
# Use Ref MCP to search for:
# - "Jest testing-library integration-testing"
# - "Playwright browser-automation e2e-testing"
# - "Node.js testing mocking-external-services"
# - "Testing backup-systems disaster-recovery"
```

## 🧠 STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING STRATEGY

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for QA Planning
```typescript
// Comprehensive backup testing strategy
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Backup system testing requires: unit tests for each backup component, integration tests for multi-provider coordination, E2E tests for complete backup workflows, disaster recovery simulation, performance testing under load, security testing for access controls, and documentation validation.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding-specific test scenarios: backup during peak wedding season load, recovery during critical wedding week, multi-couple data backup integrity, supplier access security testing, admin emergency procedures, mobile backup monitoring, and cross-timezone backup scheduling.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Quality assurance challenges: testing backup integrity without corrupting production data, simulating provider failures safely, validating recovery procedures without data loss risk, testing mobile responsiveness across devices, ensuring accessibility compliance for 24/7 monitoring.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Documentation requirements: admin disaster recovery playbooks, backup monitoring user guides, troubleshooting procedures for common failures, mobile app installation guides, security compliance documentation, API documentation for backup endpoints.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Testing strategy implementation: create test database with wedding data samples, mock external storage providers for safe testing, build automated backup integrity verification, implement cross-browser mobile testing, create disaster recovery simulation environment, document all procedures with screenshots.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 5,
  totalThoughts: 5
});
```

  });

  describe('End-to-End Backup Flow', () => {
    it('should complete full backup with 3-2-1 rule compliance', async () => {
      // Test complete backup flow from trigger to completion
      const backupRequest = createTestBackupRequest();
      const result = await backupOrchestrator.performBackup(backupRequest);
      
      expect(result.success).toBe(true);
      expect(result.replicationStatus).toHaveLength(3); // 3 locations
      expect(result.integrityVerified).toBe(true);
    });

    it('should handle provider failure with automatic failover', async () => {
      // Simulate S3 provider failure during backup
      mockProviders.s3.simulateFailure();

      expect(result.replicationStatus).toHaveLength(3); // Still 3 locations
    });
  });
});
```

### 3. E2E TESTING WITH PLAYWRIGHT MCP
```typescript
// Comprehensive E2E testing scenarios
describe('Backup Dashboard E2E Tests', () => {
  it('Admin can monitor backup status and trigger manual backup', async () => {
    await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({url: '/admin/backups'});
    
    // Verify dashboard loads with current backup status
    const statusCard = await mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot();
    expect(statusCard).toContainText('System Status: Operational');
    
    // Test manual backup trigger
    await mcp__playwright__browser_click({
      element: 'manual backup button',
      ref: '[data-testid="manual-backup-trigger"]'
    });
    
    // Fill backup form
    await mcp__playwright__browser_fill_form({

    // Submit and verify backup initiated
    await mcp__playwright__browser_click({
      element: 'start backup button',
      ref: '[data-testid="start-backup"]'
    });
    
    // Verify backup progress appears
    await mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for({text: 'Backup in progress'});
    
    // Take screenshot for documentation
    await mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot({
      filename: 'backup-progress-screenshot.png'
    });
  });

  it('Mobile backup monitoring works across devices', async () => {
    // Test mobile responsive design
    await mcp__playwright__browser_resize({width: 375, height: 667});
    await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({url: '/admin/backups'});
    
    const mobileSnapshot = await mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot();
    await mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot({
      filename: 'mobile-backup-dashboard.png'
    });
    
    // Test tablet view
    await mcp__playwright__browser_resize({width: 768, height: 1024});
    await mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot({
      filename: 'tablet-backup-dashboard.png'
    });
    
    // Verify touch interactions work
    await mcp__playwright__browser_click({
      element: 'backup status card',
      ref: '[data-testid="backup-status-mobile"]'
    });
  });
});
```

### 4. DISASTER RECOVERY TESTING
```typescript
// Disaster recovery simulation tests
describe('Disaster Recovery Procedures', () => {
  it('should restore wedding data to specific point in time', async () => {
    // Create test scenario: backup at T0, add data at T1, restore to T0
    const backupT0 = await createTestBackup('initial-state');
    await addTestWeddingData('new-bookings');
    
    const recoveryResult = await disasterRecovery.initiatePointInTimeRecovery(
      backupT0.timestamp
    );
    
    expect(recoveryResult.success).toBe(true);
    expect(recoveryResult.dataLossMinutes).toBeLessThan(60); // RPO target
    expect(recoveryResult.recoveryDurationMinutes).toBeLessThan(240); // RTO target
  });

  it('should validate backup integrity before restoration', async () => {
    const corruptedBackup = await createCorruptedBackup();
    
    const integrityCheck = await backupValidator.verifyBackupIntegrity(
      corruptedBackup.backupId
    );
    
    expect(integrityCheck.valid).toBe(false);
    expect(integrityCheck.errors).toContain('Checksum mismatch');
    
    // Verify recovery refuses corrupted backup
    await expect(
      disasterRecovery.initiatePointInTimeRecovery(corruptedBackup.timestamp)
    ).rejects.toThrow('Backup integrity validation failed');
  });
});
```
