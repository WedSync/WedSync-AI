ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/performance/budget-export/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/performance/budget-export/export-optimizer.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

## üéØ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT

**As a:** Wedding couple using WedMe on mobile devices while managing vendors on-site
**I want to:** Generate and access budget reports quickly on my phone without performance issues
**So that:** I can share payment information instantly with vendors during meetings and check budget status in real-time

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Sarah is at a venue walkthrough with her wedding planner and needs to immediately share their catering budget breakdown with the venue coordinator to negotiate package pricing. Mike is meeting with their DJ and wants to show their entertainment budget allocation on his phone. The export system must work seamlessly on mobile, load quickly, and not consume excessive data or battery life during critical wedding planning moments.
