# TEAM B - ROUND 1: WS-194 - Environment Management
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build comprehensive environment configuration system with automated secret rotation, validation pipelines, and wedding deployment orchestration
**FEATURE ID:** WS-194 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about configuration validation, secret management automation, and deployment safety

## ðŸŽ¯ TEAM-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### TEAM B SPECIALIZATION: **BACKEND/API FOCUS**

**SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:**
- Comprehensive environment configuration validator with Zod schema validation and wedding industry compliance
- Automated secret rotation system with API key management for Stripe, Twilio, OpenAI integrations
- Environment variable management with encrypted storage and secure deployment pipelines
- Database connectivity validation with Supabase health checks and connection pool monitoring
- Feature flag management system with environment-specific rollouts and wedding workflow toggles
- Deployment validation with pre-deployment checks and wedding season safety protocols

**WEDDING DEPLOYMENT CONTEXT:**
- Validate wedding API integrations (payment processing, SMS notifications, AI features) across environments
- Ensure database configurations support wedding data load during peak season deployments
- Manage environment-specific feature flags for wedding industry features and vendor types
- Coordinate secret rotation schedules to avoid disruption during peak wedding booking periods
- Implement deployment safety checks for wedding-critical systems and data consistency validation

### PRIMARY DELIVERABLES:
- [ ] **Environment Configuration Validator**: Zod-based validation with wedding industry requirements
- [ ] **Automated Secret Rotation System**: API key lifecycle management with zero-downtime rotation
- [ ] **Feature Flag Management APIs**: Environment-specific flag control with wedding workflow context
- [ ] **Deployment Health Checker**: Pre-deployment validation with wedding system compatibility
- [ ] **Configuration Compliance Monitor**: Security and compliance validation for wedding data protection

```

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA

### CONFIGURATION VALIDATION:
- All environment variables validated with proper types and wedding industry requirements
- Database connectivity confirmed with Supabase health checks and query validation
- External service credentials verified (Stripe, Twilio, OpenAI) with connection testing
- Wedding-specific configurations validated for data protection and compliance requirements

### SECRET MANAGEMENT:
- Automated secret rotation completes without service interruption or data loss
- API key management maintains wedding payment processing and communication continuity
- Secret expiration monitoring prevents service disruptions during peak wedding seasons
- Zero-downtime rotation protocols ensure wedding workflows remain unaffected
