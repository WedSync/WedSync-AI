# TEAM A - ROUND 1: WS-199 - Rate Limiting System
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build comprehensive rate limiting dashboard with real-time usage monitoring, subscription tier visualization, and abuse prevention interfaces
**FEATURE ID:** WS-199 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about rate limit visualization, usage monitoring, and subscription upgrade interfaces

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/admin/rate-limiting/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/admin/rate-limiting/RateLimitDashboard.tsx | head -20
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/rate-limiting/
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test rate-limit-dashboard
npm test rate-limiting-components
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

## 🎯 TEAM-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### TEAM A SPECIALIZATION: **FRONTEND/UI FOCUS**

**UI ARCHITECTURE:**
- Real-time rate limiting dashboard with usage monitoring and subscription tier visualization
- Interactive abuse detection interface with pattern recognition and automated response displays
- Subscription tier comparison with rate limit benefits and upgrade recommendation systems
- API usage analytics with endpoint-specific monitoring and wedding industry usage patterns
- Rate limit violation alerts with clear upgrade paths and retry guidance for users
- Accessibility-compliant rate limiting interface with screen reader support for monitoring systems

**WEDDING RATE LIMITING CONTEXT:**
- Display supplier API usage patterns during peak wedding planning seasons
- Show couple form submission rate limits with bridal show traffic spike monitoring
- Track photographer portfolio upload limits with subscription tier comparisons
- Monitor venue booking API usage with peak season multiplier visualizations
- Visualize wedding industry endpoint usage patterns and optimization recommendations

## 📋 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION ANALYSIS

Based on WS-199 specification:

### Frontend Requirements:
1. **Rate Limit Dashboard**: Real-time usage monitoring with subscription tier breakdowns
2. **Abuse Detection Interface**: Pattern recognition with automated response visualization
3. **Subscription Tier Manager**: Rate limit comparison and upgrade recommendation system
4. **API Usage Analytics**: Endpoint-specific monitoring with wedding industry insights
5. **Violation Alert System**: Clear upgrade paths and retry guidance for rate limit violations

### Component Architecture:
```typescript
// Main Dashboard Component
interface RateLimitDashboardProps {
  rateLimitMetrics: RateLimitMetrics[];
  violationAlerts: RateViolation[];
  subscriptionTierLimits: TierLimits[];
  realTimeUpdates: boolean;
}

// Usage Monitor Component
interface UsageMonitorProps {
  currentUsage: UsageMetrics;
  subscriptionLimits: SubscriptionLimits;
  endpointBreakdown: EndpointUsage[];
}

// Abuse Detection Interface
interface AbuseDetectionInterfaceProps {
  suspiciousPatterns: SuspiciousPattern[];
  automatedResponses: AutomatedResponse[];
  violationHistory: ViolationHistory[];
}
```
