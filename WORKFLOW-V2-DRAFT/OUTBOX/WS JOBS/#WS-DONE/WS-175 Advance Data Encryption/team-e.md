# TEAM E - ROUND 1: WS-175 - Advanced Data Encryption - QA/Testing & Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-29  
**Feature ID:** WS-175 (Track all work with this ID)  
**Priority:** P1 - Security Critical
**Mission:** Create comprehensive security testing suite and documentation for encryption system.
**Context:** You are Team E working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before next round.

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/__tests__/security/encryption/
cat /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/__tests__/security/encryption/encryption-security.test.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test security/encryption
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## üéØ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT

**As a:** Wedding business owner handling client data
**I want to:** Comprehensive testing that proves encryption protects guest privacy
**So that:** I can confidently assure couples their personal information is secure

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
A wedding coordinator needs to demonstrate to couples that their 200+ guest contacts, dietary requirements, and personal notes are encrypted and secure, with proper testing documentation for insurance and compliance audits.

## üìö STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION & REQUIREMENTS

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Load navigation and security requirements from centralized templates:**

```typescript
// MANDATORY: Load team prompt templates for requirements
await mcp__serena__read_file("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/03-DEV-MANAGER/TEAM-PROMPT-TEMPLATES.md");

// This contains:
// - Navigation Integration Requirements (MANDATORY for all UI features)
// - Security Requirements (MANDATORY for all API routes)  
// - UI Technology Stack requirements
// - All centralized checklists
```
