# TEAM C - ROUND 1: WS-179 - Incident Response System
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build comprehensive security incident response integrations with external security tools, notification systems, and automated response orchestration
**FEATURE ID:** WS-179 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about security incident coordination across multiple systems and vendors

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/incident/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/incident/integration-manager.ts | head -20
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/incident/external-tools/
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test incident-integration
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## üìö STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query security and integration patterns
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("security.*integration|notification.*system|incident.*response");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("SecurityService", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/lib/security/");
```

### B. UI STYLE GUIDES & TECHNOLOGY STACK (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Load the correct UI Style Guide
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");
```

**üö® CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
- **Integration Layer**: TypeScript/Node.js with secure HTTP clients
- **External Tools**: SIEM, SOAR, Security monitoring platforms
- **Notifications**: Slack, Teams, Email, SMS, PagerDuty integration
- **Message Queues**: For reliable incident response processing
- **API Standards**: RESTful APIs with OAuth 2.0/API key authentication

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation SPECIFIC to security integrations
# Use Ref MCP to search for security tool integration patterns
# Focus on SIEM integration, notification systems, webhook handling
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Integration Architecture
```typescript
// Use for complex integration decisions
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This incident response system requires integration with multiple external security tools like SIEM systems, notification platforms, and automated response tools. I need to design a flexible integration layer that can handle different vendor APIs while ensuring reliable incident propagation and response coordination.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

- Real-time incident notification orchestration
- Webhook handling and payload validation
- External API client management with authentication
- Integration health monitoring and failure recovery
- Data transformation between internal and external formats

**WEDDING SECURITY CONTEXT:**

- Connect with vendor management systems for supplier security issues
- Ensure guest data privacy during security incident investigations

## üìã TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION ANALYSIS

Based on WS-179 specification:

### Core Integration Requirements:
1. **SIEM Integration**: Send security incidents to Security Information and Event Management systems
2. **Notification Orchestration**: Multi-channel notifications (Slack, Teams, Email, SMS, PagerDuty)
3. **Automated Response Tools**: Integration with SOAR platforms for automated incident response
4. **Monitoring Integration**: Connect with security monitoring tools for real-time threat detection
5. **Compliance Reporting**: Automated compliance report generation and submission

### Integration Architecture:
```typescript
// Integration Manager Interface
interface SecurityToolIntegration {
  sendIncident(incident: SecurityIncident): Promise<void>;
  getStatus(): Promise<IntegrationStatus>;
  validateConfiguration(): Promise<boolean>;
}

// Notification System Interface  
interface NotificationProvider {
  sendAlert(alert: SecurityAlert): Promise<void>;
  sendEscalation(incident: SecurityIncident): Promise<void>;
  getDeliveryStatus(messageId: string): Promise<DeliveryStatus>;
}
