# TEAM E - ROUND 1: WS-179 - Incident Response System
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Develop comprehensive incident response testing suite, security validation framework, and complete documentation for emergency security procedures
**FEATURE ID:** WS-179 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about security testing scenarios, incident response validation, and comprehensive documentation

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/__tests__/security/incident-response/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/__tests__/security/incident-response/detection-engine.test.ts | head -20
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/docs/security/incident-response/
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test security/incident-response
npm run test:e2e -- --grep "incident response"
# MUST show: "All tests passing" with >90% coverage
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## üìö STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query testing and security patterns
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("test.*security|incident.*test|security.*validation");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("SecurityTest", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("__tests__/security/");
```

### B. UI STYLE GUIDES & TECHNOLOGY STACK (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Load testing and documentation style guides
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");
```

**üö® CRITICAL TESTING TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
- **Testing Framework**: Jest with security-focused assertions
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright MCP for incident response workflows
- **Security Testing**: OWASP ZAP integration for vulnerability scanning
- **Performance Testing**: Artillery for incident response load testing
- **Documentation**: Markdown with security compliance requirements
- **Monitoring**: Test result dashboards with security metrics

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation SPECIFIC to security testing
# Use Ref MCP to search for security testing patterns
# Focus on incident response testing, security validation, penetration testing
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Testing Strategy
```typescript
// Use for complex testing architecture
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Testing an incident response system requires simulating real security threats without actually compromising the system. I need to design comprehensive test scenarios that cover attack vectors, response times, notification systems, and recovery procedures. The testing must validate that the system can handle incidents affecting millions of wedding users while maintaining data integrity and compliance requirements.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 7
});
```
