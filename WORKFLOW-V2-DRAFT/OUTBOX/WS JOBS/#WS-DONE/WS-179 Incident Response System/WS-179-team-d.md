## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/incident/infrastructure/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/incident/infrastructure/monitoring-service.ts | head -20
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/mobile/incident/
```

npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test incident-infrastructure
npm test mobile-incident
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query infrastructure and mobile patterns
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("infrastructure.*monitor|mobile.*security|realtime.*incident");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("MonitoringService", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/lib/monitoring/");

```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Infrastructure Architecture
```typescript
// Use for complex infrastructure decisions
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This incident response infrastructure needs to be highly available and scalable to handle security incidents affecting millions of wedding users. I need to design a system that can automatically deploy security countermeasures, provide real-time monitoring of threats, and enable mobile incident response for security teams on the go. The infrastructure must handle massive traffic spikes during incidents while maintaining sub-second response times.",
