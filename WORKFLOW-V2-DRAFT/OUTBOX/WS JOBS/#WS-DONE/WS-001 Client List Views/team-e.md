# TEAM E - ROUND 1: WS-001 - Client List Views - QA/Testing & Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-29  
**Feature ID:** WS-001 (Track all work with this ID)
**Priority:** P0 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Comprehensive testing strategy and documentation for client list views across all platforms and user scenarios  
**Context:** You are Team E working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before next round.

---

## =¨ CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**  MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/__tests__/integration/client-list/
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/docs/features/client-list-views/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/__tests__/e2e/client-list.spec.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
# MUST show: Coverage >90% for client list components
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

---

## <¯ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT

**As a:** Wedding coordinator training new team members
**I want to:** Clear documentation and reliable testing that ensures the client list works perfectly
**So that:** New staff can quickly learn the system and wedding photographers never experience data loss or system failures

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Wedding businesses can't afford system failures during peak season. A photographer losing access to client data during wedding season could ruin their reputation. Comprehensive testing and documentation ensures 99.9% uptime and smooth user experience across all devices and scenarios.

## =Ú STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION & REQUIREMENTS

```typescript
// MANDATORY: Load team prompt templates for requirements
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/03-DEV-MANAGER/TEAM-PROMPT-TEMPLATES.md");
```

## >à STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING

### QA-Specific Sequential Thinking Analysis

```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Testing requirements for client list views: Unit tests for each view component (list, grid, calendar, kanban), integration tests between frontend and API, E2E tests for complete user workflows, accessibility testing for WCAG compliance, performance testing under load, cross-browser compatibility testing.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding-specific test scenarios: Photographer managing 50+ clients, rapid filtering during busy season, mobile usage during venue visits, offline access when WiFi fails, real-time updates across multiple team members, bulk operations during client onboarding periods.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Documentation needs: User guides for photographers with screenshots, technical API documentation, troubleshooting guides for common issues, accessibility documentation, mobile app usage instructions, integration guides for external tools.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Quality assurance process: Validate all team implementations, verify integration between teams A/B/C/D, create comprehensive test suite, document bugs and resolutions, establish performance benchmarks, create user acceptance criteria for wedding professionals.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

    it('should render list of clients correctly', () => {
      render(<ClientListView clients={mockClientData} />);
      expect(screen.getByTestId('client-list')).toBeInTheDocument();
      expect(screen.getAllByTestId('client-row')).toHaveLength(50); // Paginated
    });
