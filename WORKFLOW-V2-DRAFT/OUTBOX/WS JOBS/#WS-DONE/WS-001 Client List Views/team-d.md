**Date:** 2025-08-29  
**Feature ID:** WS-001 (Track all work with this ID)

## =¨ CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**  MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/performance/
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/mobile/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/performance/client-list-optimizer.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test src/lib/performance src/components/mobile
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## <¯ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT

**As a:** Wedding photographer checking client details on mobile during venue visits
**I want to:** Access client lists instantly on my phone, even with poor connectivity
**So that:** I can reference couple preferences and timeline details while coordinating with vendors on-site

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Photographers often visit venues with limited WiFi and need to reference client details during setup. Current web apps are slow on mobile and fail offline. With PWA optimization and offline caching, they get instant access to client information even in basement venues or rural locations.

## =Ú STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION & REQUIREMENTS

```typescript
// MANDATORY: Load team prompt templates for requirements
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/03-DEV-MANAGER/TEAM-PROMPT-TEMPLATES.md");
```

## >à STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR MOBILE PERFORMANCE

### Mobile-Specific Sequential Thinking Analysis

```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Mobile optimization for client lists requires: PWA service worker for offline caching, image optimization for couple photos, lazy loading for long lists, touch-optimized interactions, reduced bundle size for faster loading on mobile networks, and graceful degradation for poor connectivity.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Performance challenges: 500+ client cards with images will overwhelm mobile browsers, virtual scrolling essential, image compression needed, cache strategy for offline access, touch gestures for swipe actions, responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "PWA requirements: Service worker for caching client data, offline fallback pages, background sync when connection returns, push notifications for client updates, app-like navigation, install prompts for mobile users.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Implementation strategy: Implement service worker with cache-first strategy for client data, optimize images with next/image, create mobile-specific components with touch gestures, add performance monitoring, implement background sync for offline changes.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

## =ñ MOBILE & PWA IMPLEMENTATION

### Service Worker Implementation:
```typescript
// Service Worker for offline client list access
const CACHE_NAME = 'client-list-v1';
const OFFLINE_URLS = [
  '/clients',
  '/api/clients',
  '/offline-fallback'
];

self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(CACHE_NAME)
      .then((cache) => cache.addAll(OFFLINE_URLS))
  );
});

self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  if (event.request.url.includes('/api/clients')) {
    event.respondWith(
      caches.match(event.request)
        .then((response) => {
          // Cache-first strategy for client data
          return response || fetch(event.request)
            .then((fetchResponse) => {
              const responseClone = fetchResponse.clone();
              caches.open(CACHE_NAME)
                .then((cache) => cache.put(event.request, responseClone));
              return fetchResponse;
            });
        })
    );
  }
});
```

### Mobile Touch Optimization:
```typescript
// Mobile-optimized client list component
export function ClientListMobile({ clients }: { clients: ClientListItem[] }) {
  const [touchStart, setTouchStart] = useState<number | null>(null);
  
  const handleTouchStart = (e: TouchEvent, clientId: string) => {
    setTouchStart(e.touches[0].clientX);
  };
  
  const handleTouchEnd = (e: TouchEvent, clientId: string) => {
    if (!touchStart) return;
    
    const touchEnd = e.changedTouches[0].clientX;
    const diff = touchStart - touchEnd;
    
    if (Math.abs(diff) > 50) {
      // Swipe detected - show quick actions
      if (diff > 0) {
        showQuickActions(clientId, 'left');
      } else {
        showQuickActions(clientId, 'right');
      }
    }
    
    setTouchStart(null);
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="touch-pan-y">
      {clients.map((client) => (
        <div
          key={client.id}
          onTouchStart={(e) => handleTouchStart(e.nativeEvent, client.id)}
          onTouchEnd={(e) => handleTouchEnd(e.nativeEvent, client.id)}
          className="min-h-[44px] touch-manipulation"
        >
          <ClientCard client={client} mobile={true} />
        </div>
      ))}
