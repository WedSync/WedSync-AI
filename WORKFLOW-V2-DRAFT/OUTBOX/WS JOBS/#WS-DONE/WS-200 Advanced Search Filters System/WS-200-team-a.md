**FEATURE ID:** WS-200 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about wedding professional search workflows and multi-entity filtering complexity

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## üìö STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query search-related components and patterns
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("search|filter|SearchBox|FilterComponent");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("SearchInput", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/components/ui/");
```

### B. UI STYLE GUIDES & TECHNOLOGY STACK (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Load the SaaS UI Style Guide
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");
```

**üö® CRITICAL UI TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
- **Untitled UI**: Primary component library (MANDATORY)
- **Magic UI**: Animations and visual enhancements (MANDATORY)
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.11**: Utility-first CSS
- **Lucide React**: Icons ONLY

**‚ùå DO NOT USE:**
- Radix UI, Catalyst UI, shadcn/ui, or any other component libraries

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation for search/filtering components
mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("React advanced search components filtering UI patterns Untitled UI")
mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("TypeScript search interface filtering state management")
mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("Next.js 15 server components search API integration")
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX SEARCH SYSTEM

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Search Architecture
```typescript
// Complex search system requires systematic analysis
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Advanced search system for wedding data needs: 1) Multi-entity search (clients, suppliers, events), 2) Complex filtering with date ranges, status combinations, tags, 3) Saved search functionality, 4) Real-time filtering as user types, 5) Wedding-specific filters like venue type, guest count, budget ranges. The UI must be intuitive for busy wedding planners managing 50+ concurrent weddings.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Component architecture: SearchFiltersContainer (main component), QuickFilters (one-click common searches), AdvancedFilterPanel (expandable detailed filters), SavedSearches (stored filter combinations), FilterChips (active filter display), SearchResultsGrid (filtered results display). State management with Zustand for complex filter state and real-time updates.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding-specific filter categories needed: Client filters (wedding date, budget range, venue type, guest count, status), Supplier filters (category, availability, rating, location), Event filters (date ranges, status, venue type, season), Task filters (due dates, assignment, completion status). Each category needs different UI patterns - date pickers, range sliders, multi-select dropdowns.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Performance considerations: Debounced search input to avoid excessive API calls, virtual scrolling for large result sets, optimistic UI updates, pagination for search results, filter state persistence in URL for bookmarkable searches, loading states and skeleton components during search execution.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Mobile-first responsive design: Collapsible filter panels on mobile, touch-friendly filter controls, bottom sheet filter modal on small screens, swipe gestures for filter chips, optimized for one-handed use during venue visits. Accessibility: proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support for complex filter combinations.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 5,
  totalThoughts: 5
});
```
