# TEAM E - ROUND 1: WS-165 - Payment Calendar - Testing & Quality Assurance

**Date:** 2025-08-29  
**Feature ID:** WS-165 (Track all work with this ID)  
**Priority:** P1 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Comprehensive testing and quality assurance for payment calendar system with validation workflows  
**Context:** You are Team E working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before next round.

---

## 🎯 USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding couple depending on reliable payment deadline tracking
**I want to:** Trust that payment reminders will be delivered accurately and payment status will be synchronized correctly across all devices
**So that:** I never face wedding day disasters due to missed vendor payments or financial surprises

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
A couple missed their final venue payment because the payment calendar showed the wrong due date, resulting in venue cancellation two weeks before their wedding. Another couple received 50 duplicate payment reminder emails in one hour due to a notification loop. The Testing & Quality Assurance system prevents these disasters by validating every payment calculation, testing all notification delivery scenarios, and ensuring data consistency across mobile and desktop platforms so couples can trust their payment calendar completely during the stressful wedding planning period.

---

## 🎯 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

**From Technical Specification:**
- Comprehensive test suite covering all payment calendar functionality
- Integration testing for cross-team API contracts and data flows
- Performance testing for payment calendar load times and responsiveness
- Security testing for payment data protection and access controls
- Accessibility testing ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility validation

**Technology Stack (VERIFIED):**
- Frontend: Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4
- UI Library: Untitled UI (MANDATORY - no other component libraries allowed)
- Animations: Magic UI (MANDATORY for all animations)
- Icons: Lucide React (ONLY icon library allowed)
- Database: PostgreSQL via MCP Server (✅ CONNECTED - Direct Supabase access available)
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL 15), Edge Functions
- Testing: Playwright MCP, Vitest

**Integration Points:**
- Team A (Frontend UI): Component testing and UI validation workflows
- Team B (Backend APIs): API contract testing and data validation
- Team C (Integration): Service integration testing and notification validation
- Team D (Mobile): Mobile testing coordination and performance validation

---

## 📚 STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. LOAD CORRECT UI STYLE GUIDE (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK):
await mcp__Ref__ref_read_url("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. REF MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "Playwright testing comprehensive E2E scenarios"});
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "Vitest unit testing React 19 components"});
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "Accessibility testing WCAG 2.1 AA compliance"});

// 3. UNDERSTAND EXISTING PATTERNS:
// Use Grep to find similar testing implementations
// Use Read to examine existing test configurations
// Use LS to understand testing architecture structure
```

**WHY THIS ORDER MATTERS:**
- Ref MCP prevents using deprecated APIs (libraries change frequently!)
- UI Style Guides ensure consistent design patterns
- Understanding existing patterns prevents reinventing solutions
- Teams work with current, accurate knowledge

---

## 🧠 STEP 1.5: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURES (WHEN NEEDED)

**Use Sequential Thinking MCP for complex features requiring structured analysis:**

```typescript
// For comprehensive testing strategy with multiple integration points
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Payment Calendar testing requires: unit tests for components, integration tests for API contracts, E2E tests for user workflows, performance tests for load times, security tests for data protection. Need to analyze testing dependencies between teams and ensure comprehensive coverage without duplication.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 6
});

// Continue with structured analysis for:
// - Test strategy coordination across all teams
// - Risk assessment for payment calculation accuracy
// - Performance benchmarking and quality gates
// - Accessibility validation and compliance verification
```

---

## 🚀 STEP 2: LAUNCH PARALLEL AGENTS (AFTER documentation loaded!)

**NOW that you have current docs, launch agents with specific knowledge:**

1. **task-tracker-coordinator** --think-ultra-hard --with-ref-docs --track-dependencies "Comprehensive payment calendar testing strategy"
2. **test-automation-architect** --think-ultra-hard --use-loaded-docs --comprehensive-coverage "Payment system testing architecture" 
3. **wedding-domain-expert** --think-ultra-hard --wedding-context --user-focused "Critical payment testing scenarios for wedding planning"
4. **security-compliance-officer** --think-ultra-hard --check-current-best-practices --validate-all-inputs "Payment data security testing and validation"
5. **playwright-visual-testing-specialist** --accessibility-first --comprehensive-validation --cross-browser "Visual and accessibility testing validation"
6. **performance-optimization-expert** --performance-testing --benchmark-validation --quality-gates "Payment calendar performance testing"
7. **code-quality-guardian** --test-quality --coverage-validation --enforce-standards "Testing standards and quality assurance"

**AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** "Use the Ref MCP documentation loaded in Step 1. Follow patterns found in existing code."

**AGENT USAGE TARGET:** >75% of session time in parallel execution

## 📋 STEP 3: DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (With loaded docs + agents)

### **EXPLORE PHASE (NO CODING!)**
- Read ALL relevant testing files and configurations first using Read tool
- Understand existing testing patterns and conventions using Grep
- Check integration points with all other teams with LS and Read
- Review similar testing implementations thoroughly
- Continue until you FULLY understand the testing architecture

### **PLAN PHASE (THINK ULTRA HARD!)**
- Create comprehensive testing strategy for payment calendar
- Write test specifications FIRST (behavior-driven development)
- Plan error scenarios and edge cases for payment failures
- Consider accessibility and performance testing requirements
- Plan cross-team integration testing coordination

### **CODE PHASE (PARALLEL AGENTS!)**
- Write tests following behavior-driven development approach
- Follow existing patterns from loaded documentation
- Use Ref MCP examples as templates
- Implement with parallel agents working together
- Focus on completeness and quality over speed

### **COMMIT PHASE (VERIFY EVERYTHING!)**
- Run all tests and ensure 100% pass rate
- Verify comprehensive coverage across all teams
- Create complete evidence package
- Generate detailed reports with metrics
- Only mark complete when ACTUALLY complete with proof
