# TEAM D - ROUND 1: WS-190 - Incident Response Procedures
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build scalable incident response infrastructure with mobile emergency interfaces, automated deployment systems, and high-availability security monitoring
**FEATURE ID:** WS-190 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about mobile emergency response, infrastructure scalability, and performance optimization

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/mobile/security/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/infrastructure/incident-scaling.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test mobile-security
npm test infrastructure-scaling
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```
