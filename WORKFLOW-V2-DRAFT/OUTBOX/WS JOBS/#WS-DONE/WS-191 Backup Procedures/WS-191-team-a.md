# TEAM A - ROUND 1: WS-191 - Backup Procedures
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build comprehensive backup dashboard with real-time monitoring, recovery point visualization, and automated backup scheduling interfaces
**FEATURE ID:** WS-191 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about backup status visualization, recovery timeline interfaces, and 3-2-1 backup rule monitoring

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/admin/backup/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/admin/backup/BackupDashboard.tsx | head -20
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/backup/
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test backup-dashboard
npm test backup-components
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## 📚 STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query backup and monitoring patterns
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("backup.*dashboard|monitoring.*recovery|admin.*system");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("AdminDashboard", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/components/admin/");
```

### B. UI STYLE GUIDES & TECHNOLOGY STACK (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Load the correct UI Style Guide
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");
```

**🚨 CRITICAL UI TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
- **Untitled UI**: Primary component library (MANDATORY)
- **Magic UI**: Animations and visual enhancements (MANDATORY)
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.11**: Utility-first CSS
- **Lucide React**: Icons ONLY
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket/Supabase Realtime for backup status updates
- **Data Visualization**: Charts.js or D3.js for backup timeline and storage visualization

**❌ DO NOT USE:**
- Radix UI, Catalyst UI, shadcn/ui, or any other component libraries

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation SPECIFIC to backup systems and monitoring dashboards
# Use Ref MCP to search for backup monitoring patterns, progress indicators, timeline visualization
```

## 🧠 STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Dashboard Architecture
```typescript
// Use for complex UI architecture decisions
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This backup dashboard needs to display critical system reliability information with clear recovery point timelines and backup health status. I need to design interfaces that help administrators understand backup coverage, monitor 3-2-1 backup rule compliance, track storage usage across multiple locations, and provide quick access to recovery operations during emergencies. The UI must be accessible 24/7 and provide confidence during disaster recovery scenarios.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
