**WEDDING DATA CONTEXT:**
- Prioritize backup of critical wedding timelines during 30-day pre-wedding periods
- Implement supplier portfolio backup with image deduplication and compression optimization
- Ensure guest list and payment data backup with PCI compliance and encryption requirements
- Schedule venue booking and contract backup with legal document retention policies
- Track wedding date proximity for backup frequency adjustment and recovery prioritization

## üìã TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION ANALYSIS

Based on WS-191 specification:

### Backend Requirements:
1. **Backup Orchestrator**: 3-2-1 backup rule implementation with multi-cloud replication
2. **Disaster Recovery Engine**: Point-in-time recovery with data consistency validation
3. **Scheduled Backup Service**: Wedding season aware scheduling with priority management
4. **Data Integrity Validator**: Backup verification with checksum validation and corruption detection
5. **Compliance Manager**: GDPR retention policies with automated secure deletion

### API Architecture:
```typescript
// Backup Operations API
interface BackupOperationsAPI {
  createBackup(type: BackupType, components: BackupComponent[]): Promise<BackupResult>;
  initiateRecovery(targetTime: Date, components: string[]): Promise<RecoveryResult>;
  validateBackupIntegrity(backupId: string): Promise<IntegrityResult>;
  getBackupStatus(operationId: string): Promise<BackupStatus>;
}

// Disaster Recovery API
interface DisasterRecoveryAPI {
  createRecoveryPlan(scenario: DisasterScenario): Promise<RecoveryPlan>;
  executeRecovery(planId: string): Promise<RecoveryExecution>;
  validateRecoveryIntegrity(recoveryId: string): Promise<ValidationResult>;
}
```
