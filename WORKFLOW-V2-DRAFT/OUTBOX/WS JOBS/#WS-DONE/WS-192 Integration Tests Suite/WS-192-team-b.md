## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/integration/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/integration/supplier-couple-flow.test.ts | head -20
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/factories/
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test integration
npm run test:integration
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

## üéØ TEAM-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### TEAM B SPECIALIZATION: **BACKEND/API FOCUS**

**SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:**
- Comprehensive integration test framework with database transaction isolation and cleanup management
- Supplier-couple workflow testing with end-to-end data flow validation and core field synchronization
- Wedding journey automation testing with form submissions, notifications, and booking confirmations
- API integration testing with authentication, authorization, and wedding industry business logic validation
- Mock service integration for external APIs (Stripe, Twilio, email services) with wedding context simulation
- Test data factory system for consistent wedding industry scenarios and realistic data generation

**WEDDING TESTING CONTEXT:**
- Validate complete supplier-couple connection workflows with wedding data synchronization
- Test form submission flows with core wedding fields (date, venue, guest count) propagation
- Verify journey automation with photographer consultations, venue bookings, and timeline coordination
- Ensure wedding data integrity across supplier portfolio updates and client information management
- Test peak wedding season scenarios with concurrent user loads and data consistency validation

## üìã TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION ANALYSIS

Based on WS-192 specification:

### Backend Requirements:
1. **Integration Test Framework**: Transaction-based test isolation with comprehensive cleanup procedures
2. **Workflow Test Engine**: End-to-end supplier-couple flow validation with wedding data verification
3. **API Test Suite**: Comprehensive endpoint testing with authentication and authorization validation
4. **Test Data Factories**: Consistent wedding industry data generation with realistic scenarios
5. **Mock Service Manager**: External service mocking with wedding industry integration patterns

### Test Architecture:
```typescript
// Integration Test Framework
interface IntegrationTestFramework {
  createTestIsolation(testName: string): Promise<TestIsolation>;
  executeSupplierCoupleFlow(scenario: WeddingScenario): Promise<FlowResult>;
  validateDataIntegrity(entities: TestEntity[]): Promise<ValidationResult>;
  cleanupTestData(isolationId: string): Promise<CleanupResult>;
}

// Wedding Test Scenarios
interface WeddingTestScenario {
  supplierType: VendorType;
  coupleProfile: CoupleTestData;
  weddingDetails: WeddingTestData;
  expectedOutcomes: ExpectedResult[];
}
```
