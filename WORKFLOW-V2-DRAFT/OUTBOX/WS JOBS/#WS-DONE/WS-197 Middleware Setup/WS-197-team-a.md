# TEAM A - ROUND 1: WS-197 - Middleware Setup
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build comprehensive middleware monitoring dashboard with real-time security event tracking, rate limiting visualization, and authentication flow monitoring
**FEATURE ID:** WS-197 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about security monitoring interfaces, middleware performance visualization, and real-time threat detection displays

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/admin/middleware/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/admin/middleware/MiddlewareDashboard.tsx | head -20
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/security/monitoring/
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test middleware-dashboard
npm test security-monitoring
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

## 🎯 TEAM-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### TEAM A SPECIALIZATION: **FRONTEND/UI FOCUS**

**UI ARCHITECTURE:**
- Real-time middleware performance dashboard with request processing metrics and latency visualization
- Interactive security event monitoring with threat detection alerts and suspicious activity tracking
- Rate limiting status display with user tier breakdown and violation pattern analysis
- Session management interface with active user monitoring and suspicious behavior detection
- CSRF protection status with form security monitoring and validation tracking
- Accessibility-compliant security monitoring with high-contrast alerts for 24/7 operations

**WEDDING SECURITY CONTEXT:**
- Display authentication patterns for suppliers accessing client wedding data
- Show rate limiting effectiveness during bridal show traffic spikes
- Track CSRF protection for wedding form submissions and venue booking requests
- Monitor session security for suppliers managing multiple couple accounts
- Visualize middleware performance during peak wedding planning season loads

## 📋 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION ANALYSIS

Based on WS-197 specification:

### Frontend Requirements:
1. **Middleware Dashboard**: Real-time performance monitoring with request metrics
2. **Security Event Monitor**: Interactive threat detection with alert management
3. **Rate Limiting Visualizer**: Usage patterns and violation tracking by subscription tier
4. **Session Management Panel**: Active session monitoring with security analysis
5. **CSRF Protection Monitor**: Form security validation and attack prevention tracking

### Component Architecture:
```typescript
// Main Dashboard Component
interface MiddlewareDashboardProps {
  middlewareMetrics: MiddlewareMetrics;
  securityEvents: SecurityEvent[];
  rateLimitStatus: RateLimitStatus[];
  realTimeUpdates: boolean;
}

// Security Event Monitor Component
interface SecurityEventMonitorProps {
  events: SecurityEvent[];
  threatLevel: ThreatLevel;
  alertFilters: AlertFilter[];
}

// Rate Limiting Visualizer
interface RateLimitingVisualizerProps {
  limitingMetrics: RateLimitMetrics[];
  userTierBreakdown: TierUsageBreakdown[];
  violationPatterns: ViolationPattern[];
}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

### Color Coding for Security Status:
- **Secure**: Green (#10B981) - All middleware functioning normally
- **Monitoring**: Blue (#3B82F6) - Active monitoring, no threats detected
- **Warning**: Yellow (#F59E0B) - Elevated activity, monitoring increased
- **Critical**: Red (#EF4444) - Security threats detected, immediate action needed

### Dashboard Layout:
```
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────┐
│ Middleware      │ Security Event   │
│ Performance     │ Monitor          │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────┤
│ Rate Limiting   │ Session          │
│ Status          │ Management       │
└─────────────────┴──────────────────┘
