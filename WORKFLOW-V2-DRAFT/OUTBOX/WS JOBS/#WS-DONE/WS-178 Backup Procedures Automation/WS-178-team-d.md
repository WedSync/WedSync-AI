**THINK ULTRA HARD** about backup operations impact on platform performance and user experience

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/src/lib/performance/backup/
cat /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/src/lib/performance/backup/backup-performance-monitor.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test src/lib/performance/backup/
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## üìö STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query performance and monitoring patterns
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("performance.*monitor");
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("backup.*throttle");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("PerformanceMonitor", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/lib/performance/");
```

### B. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation SPECIFIC to this feature
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("Node.js performance monitoring backup operations");
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("Database backup performance optimization PostgreSQL");
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("Resource throttling during backup operations");
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("Background job performance monitoring");
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Complex Analysis
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Backup operations must not impact user experience during peak wedding planning hours. Need to implement: 1) Resource throttling during backups to limit CPU/memory usage 2) Database connection pooling to prevent backup jobs from consuming all connections 3) Off-peak scheduling with intelligent timing based on user activity patterns 4) Performance monitoring to detect backup-related slowdowns 5) Circuit breakers to halt backups if system performance degrades.",

  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
