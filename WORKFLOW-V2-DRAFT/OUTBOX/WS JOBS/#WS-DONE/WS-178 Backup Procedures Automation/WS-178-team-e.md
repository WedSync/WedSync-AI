# TEAM E - ROUND 1: WS-178 - Backup Procedures Automation
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Comprehensive testing of backup system reliability, documentation of disaster recovery procedures, and QA validation
**FEATURE ID:** WS-178 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about disaster recovery scenarios and backup failure edge cases

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/__tests__/e2e/backup/
cat /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/__tests__/e2e/backup/backup-disaster-recovery.spec.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test __tests__/e2e/backup/
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## üìö STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query testing and documentation patterns
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("test.*backup");
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("e2e.*disaster");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("PlaywrightTest", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("__tests__/");
```

### B. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation SPECIFIC to this feature
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("Playwright MCP end-to-end testing backup systems");
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("Jest unit testing database backup recovery");
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("Disaster recovery testing procedures PostgreSQL");
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("Backup system documentation best practices");
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Complex Analysis
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Testing a backup system requires comprehensive scenarios: 1) Happy path: successful backup creation, storage, and verification 2) Failure scenarios: storage provider failures, network interruptions, database corruption 3) Disaster recovery: complete system restoration from backup 4) Performance testing: backup operations under load 5) Security testing: backup encryption, access controls 6) Edge cases: partial backups, concurrent operations, storage quota limits. Documentation must enable non-technical users to execute recovery procedures.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5
});
```

## üöÄ STEP 2B: LAUNCH ENHANCED AGENTS WITH SPECIFIC MISSIONS
