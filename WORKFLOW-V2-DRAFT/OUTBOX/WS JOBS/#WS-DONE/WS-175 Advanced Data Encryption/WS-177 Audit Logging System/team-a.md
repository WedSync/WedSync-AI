## 🎯 USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT

**As a:** Wedding business owner handling client data
**I want to:** Visual dashboard showing who accessed what data when
**So that:** I can investigate security incidents and prove compliance during audits

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
A wedding planner needs to investigate why guest contact information was accessed outside business hours. The audit dashboard shows exactly who accessed which guest records, when, and from what IP address, helping identify unauthorized access patterns.

## 📚 STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION & REQUIREMENTS

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Load navigation and security requirements from centralized templates:**

```typescript
// MANDATORY: Load team prompt templates for requirements
await mcp__serena__read_file("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/03-DEV-MANAGER/TEAM-PROMPT-TEMPLATES.md");

// This contains:
// - Navigation Integration Requirements (MANDATORY for all UI features)
// - Security Requirements (MANDATORY for all API routes)  
// - UI Technology Stack requirements
// - All centralized checklists
```
