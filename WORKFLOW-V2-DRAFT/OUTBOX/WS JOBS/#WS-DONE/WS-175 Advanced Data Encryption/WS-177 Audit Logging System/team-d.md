# TEAM D - ROUND 1: WS-177 - Audit Logging System - Performance & Infrastructure

**Date:** 2025-08-29  
**Feature ID:** WS-177 (Track all work with this ID)  
**Priority:** P1 - Security Critical
**Mission:** Optimize audit logging performance and implement secure infrastructure for high-volume logging.
**Context:** You are Team D working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before next round.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/src/lib/performance/audit/
cat /Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/src/lib/performance/audit/audit-performance.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test performance/audit
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## 🎯 USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT

**As a:** Wedding supplier with high-volume guest data operations
**I want to:** Audit logging that doesn't slow down my peak wedding season workflows
**So that:** Security compliance doesn't impact my ability to serve multiple weddings efficiently

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
A wedding venue coordinator handles 50+ weddings during peak season, with frequent guest list updates, seating changes, and dietary requirement modifications. Audit logging must capture every change without adding noticeable delay to time-sensitive wedding coordination tasks.

## 📚 STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION & REQUIREMENTS

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Load navigation and security requirements from centralized templates:**

```typescript
// MANDATORY: Load team prompt templates for requirements
await mcp__serena__read_file("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/03-DEV-MANAGER/TEAM-PROMPT-TEMPLATES.md");

// This contains:
// - Navigation Integration Requirements (MANDATORY for all UI features)
// - Security Requirements (MANDATORY for all API routes)  
// - UI Technology Stack requirements
// - All centralized checklists
```
