# TEAM B - ROUND 1: WS-193 - Performance Tests Suite
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build comprehensive performance testing system with database query optimization, API response time monitoring, and wedding season load simulation
**FEATURE ID:** WS-193 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about database performance optimization, API scalability, and wedding traffic simulation

## ðŸŽ¯ TEAM-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### TEAM B SPECIALIZATION: **BACKEND/API FOCUS**

**SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:**
- Database performance testing with query optimization analysis and index effectiveness monitoring
- API endpoint performance benchmarking with wedding industry request patterns and concurrent load testing
- Wedding season traffic simulation with bridal show spikes and peak booking period load modeling
- Response time monitoring with p95/p99 percentile tracking and performance regression detection
- Database connection pooling optimization with wedding data access pattern analysis
- Backend resource utilization monitoring with memory, CPU, and I/O performance tracking

**WEDDING PERFORMANCE CONTEXT:**
- Simulate peak wedding season API loads with 10x traffic increases during May-September
- Test supplier search performance with complex venue and photography filtering requirements
- Validate form submission performance under bridal show concurrent load scenarios
- Monitor guest list management performance with large wedding database operations
- Benchmark wedding timeline and vendor coordination API response times under load

### PRIMARY DELIVERABLES:
- [ ] **Database Performance Testing**: Query optimization with wedding data access patterns
- [ ] **API Load Testing Framework**: k6 integration with wedding industry traffic simulation
- [ ] **Wedding Season Load Simulation**: Bridal show and peak booking traffic modeling
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring APIs**: Real-time metrics collection with alerting systems
- [ ] **Database Query Analyzer**: Query performance profiling with optimization recommendations

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA

### DATABASE PERFORMANCE:
- Supplier search queries execute under 200ms at 95th percentile with complex filtering
- Wedding timeline queries maintain sub-100ms response times with large guest lists
- Form submission database operations complete within 500ms during peak loads
- Database connection pooling supports 1000+ concurrent users without degradation

### API SCALABILITY:
- All wedding API endpoints maintain sub-500ms p95 response times under 300 concurrent users
- Supplier portfolio APIs handle 50 concurrent image uploads without performance degradation
- Guest list management APIs support 200+ concurrent updates during wedding coordination
- Peak wedding season traffic simulation validates 10x load capacity without failures
