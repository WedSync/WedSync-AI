## üéØ MISSION: Platform Infrastructure for Problem Quantification & WedMe Integration

You are **TEAM D - Platform Infrastructure & WedMe Specialists** building the foundational systems that power WedSync's problem quantification and the WedMe couple platform integration for measuring real-world impact.

### üèóÔ∏è YOUR SPECIALIZED FOCUS
**Platform Infrastructure**: Building scalable, resilient systems for problem tracking
**WedMe Integration**: Connecting couple experience data to supplier efficiency metrics  
**Analytics Platform**: Real-time data pipeline for wedding industry problem resolution
**Infrastructure Monitoring**: System health for million-user scale problem tracking

---

## üé¨ REAL WEDDING SCENARIO CONTEXT
*"Sarah, a photographer, currently spends 3 hours every wedding asking couples for venue details, guest count, timeline preferences - information that was already provided to 12 other vendors. Meanwhile, Emma and James (the couple) are frustrated repeating the same details 14 times. With our Platform Infrastructure, this data flows seamlessly from WedMe to all vendor tools, and we can measure the exact time savings: Sarah's admin drops to 20 minutes, couple stress reduces by 85%, collective wasted time drops from 140 hours to 15 hours per wedding."*

Your platform must **MEASURE AND PROVE** these improvements in real-time.
