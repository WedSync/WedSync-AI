# TEAM E - ROUND 1: WS-303 - Supplier Onboarding Section Overview
## 2025-01-25 - 08:00 AM

**YOUR MISSION:** Develop comprehensive testing suite and user experience validation for supplier onboarding with conversion optimization and vendor workflow documentation
**FEATURE ID:** WS-303 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about onboarding conversion rates, vendor user experience, and comprehensive testing of business verification workflows

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/onboarding
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/onboarding/conversion-funnel.test.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test onboarding
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## 🧠 STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR ONBOARDING QA

### QA-Specific Sequential Thinking Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Comprehensive Onboarding Testing Strategy
```typescript
// Onboarding testing complexity analysis  
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Onboarding testing requirements: Unit tests for wizard components and business validation, integration tests for verification APIs and document processing, E2E tests for complete vendor registration flows (photographer, venue, florist), conversion funnel testing for drop-off analysis, mobile onboarding testing across devices, accessibility testing for inclusive vendor registration.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Vendor-specific test scenarios: Photographer uploading business license via mobile camera, venue coordinator completing setup during busy event planning, florist registering with multiple service locations, caterer setting up integration with existing booking system, DJ configuring music licensing verification, each with different validation requirements and business rules.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Conversion optimization testing: A/B testing different onboarding flows, measuring completion rates at each step, identifying drop-off points in verification process, testing different business document upload experiences, validating notification timing for maximum engagement, ensuring mobile conversion matches desktop rates.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Quality assurance priorities: Test business verification with various document types and quality levels, validate integration with third-party verification services, ensure offline onboarding works reliably, verify cross-platform sync maintains data consistency, document all vendor workflows with troubleshooting guides for business registration issues.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```
