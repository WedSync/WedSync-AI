## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR MOBILE ONBOARDING

### Platform-Specific Sequential Thinking Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Mobile-First Onboarding Strategy
```typescript
// Mobile onboarding complexity analysis
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Mobile vendor onboarding needs: touch-optimized wizard steps for business registration, offline capability for areas with poor connectivity during business setup, camera integration for business document capture, location services for service area setup, and progressive web app installation prompts for frequent business management access.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Mobile UX considerations: Wedding vendors often sign up during downtime between clients (photographers between shoots, florists during lunch breaks), business document photography needs clear capture guidance, form inputs must work with mobile keyboards, progress must save automatically for interruptions, conversion rates are critical for mobile signups.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Offline capabilities: Business information forms need offline storage, document capture must work without internet, verification progress must sync when connection restored, onboarding resume must work across sessions, critical business data needs encrypted local storage for security.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Implementation strategy: Progressive enhancement for mobile-first design, service worker for offline onboarding data, camera API for document capture, geolocation for service area setup, push notifications for verification updates, cross-platform data sync for vendor account continuity.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```
