```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Frontend-Specific Sequential Thinking Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Complex Onboarding Architecture Analysis
```typescript
// Before building complex supplier onboarding UI components
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Supplier onboarding wizard needs: progressive step-by-step flow (business info ‚Üí service details ‚Üí pricing setup ‚Üí integrations ‚Üí verification), vendor-type-specific customization (photographer vs venue vs florist different workflows), progress tracking with save/resume capability, mobile-first design for vendors who sign up on phones, and conversion optimization to maximize trial-to-paid conversions.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "State management analysis: Onboarding form data needs persistence across sessions (vendors often get interrupted), step validation requires real-time feedback, progress tracking needs visual indicators, vendor type selection affects subsequent step visibility, integration testing needs sandbox/demo modes before live connection.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Component architecture: OnboardingWizard (main orchestrator), StepperNavigation (progress indicator), VendorTypeSelector (business categorization), BusinessInfoStep, ServiceDetailsStep, PricingSetupStep, IntegrationStep, VerificationStep. Each needs proper validation, error handling, and smooth transitions with wedding vendor context.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding vendor UX considerations: Photographers sign up between shoots with limited time, venues need comprehensive setup during off-season planning, florists want quick setup to test during busy wedding season, caterers need integration with existing systems. Design for interruption-friendly workflows, clear value proposition at each step, and immediate utility even before full setup.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS

### Things that will break vendor onboarding conversion:
- **Long, complex forms** - Wedding vendors have limited attention spans between clients
- **Mobile unfriendly interface** - 70% of signups happen on mobile during downtime
- **Lost progress on interruption** - Vendors get phone calls, need to resume later
- **Generic, non-wedding focused flow** - Must feel relevant to wedding industry
- **Poor performance on mobile** - Slow loading kills conversion rates

### Onboarding UX Failures to Avoid:
- **Too many steps** - Keep to 5-7 steps maximum for completion
- **Unclear value proposition** - Each step must show clear benefit
- **Required fields without clear purpose** - Only ask for essential information initially
- **No progress indication** - Users need to see how much is left
- **Validation errors without guidance** - Provide clear correction instructions

## üß≠ CRITICAL: NAVIGATION INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI FEATURES)

### ONBOARDING MUST INTEGRATE INTO AUTHENTICATION FLOW

**‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Creating standalone onboarding without auth integration**
**‚úÖ MANDATORY: Onboarding must connect to registration and login systems**

#### ONBOARDING INTEGRATION CHECKLIST

1. **Registration Flow Integration:**
```typescript
// MUST integrate with user registration system
// File: $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx
const handleRegistrationComplete = async (userData: UserData) => {
  await createUserAccount(userData);
  router.push('/onboarding?new=true');
};

// Onboarding wizard must receive user context
const OnboardingPage = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  if (!user) {
    redirect('/auth/signup');
  }
  
  return <OnboardingWizard userId={user.id} />;
};
```

2. **Post-Onboarding Navigation:**
```typescript
// MUST redirect to appropriate dashboard after completion
const handleOnboardingComplete = (onboardingData: OnboardingData) => {
  // Save onboarding data
  await saveSupplierProfile(onboardingData);
  
  // Redirect to supplier dashboard
  router.push('/dashboard?welcome=true');
};
```

3. **Progress Tracking Integration:**
```typescript
// MUST update user profile with onboarding progress
const updateOnboardingProgress = async (step: number, data: StepData) => {
  await supabase
    .from('user_profiles')
    .update({ 
      onboarding_progress: step,
      onboarding_data: data 
    })
    .eq('id', userId);
};
```
