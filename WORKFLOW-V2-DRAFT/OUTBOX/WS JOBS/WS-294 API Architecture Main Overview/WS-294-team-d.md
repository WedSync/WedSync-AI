# TEAM D - ROUND 1: WS-294 - API Architecture Main Overview
## 2025-09-03 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Implement API performance optimization, caching strategies, monitoring systems, and infrastructure scalability for wedding-critical API operations
**FEATURE ID:** WS-294 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about wedding day performance requirements, API scalability during peak wedding seasons, and infrastructure resilience

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/performance/api/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/performance/api/APIPerformanceMonitor.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test performance api monitoring
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## üìö STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query existing performance monitoring and caching patterns
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("performance monitoring api caching optimization");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("Performance Monitor Cache", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/performance/");
```

### B. PERFORMANCE & INFRASTRUCTURE STANDARDS (MANDATORY FOR PERFORMANCE WORK)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Load performance optimization patterns
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// Load existing performance patterns for consistency
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("api performance caching redis monitoring patterns");
```

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation SPECIFIC to API performance and monitoring
mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("API performance optimization caching strategies monitoring Next.js Redis");
mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("wedding software performance requirements scalability infrastructure monitoring");
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR API PERFORMANCE ARCHITECTURE

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Performance Optimization Planning
```typescript
// Use for comprehensive performance architecture decisions
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Wedding API performance has unique requirements: Saturday wedding days need <100ms response times for critical operations, vendor coordination APIs need to handle 10x traffic during wedding season (May-October), and couple onboarding APIs need to process large data imports efficiently",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 6
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking({
  thought: "API caching strategy must understand wedding data patterns: venue availability changes frequently, supplier profiles are relatively static, couple wedding details change often during planning but become static near wedding day. Cache invalidation must be intelligent and wedding-context aware",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 6
});
```

## üöÄ STEP 2B: LAUNCH ENHANCED AGENTS WITH SPECIFIC MISSIONS

Launch these agents with comprehensive performance requirements:

1. **task-tracker-coordinator** - Break down performance work, track optimization targets
2. **performance-optimization-expert** - Use Serena for performance pattern consistency  
3. **security-compliance-officer** - Ensure performance monitoring security
4. **code-quality-guardian** - Maintain performance code quality standards
5. **test-automation-architect** - Performance testing and load testing
6. **documentation-chronicler** - Evidence-based performance documentation

## üîí SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE!)

### API PERFORMANCE SECURITY CHECKLIST:
- [ ] **Monitoring data protection** - Performance metrics don't leak sensitive data
- [ ] **Cache security** - Cached data properly encrypted and access-controlled
- [ ] **Rate limiting bypass prevention** - Performance optimizations don't circumvent security
- [ ] **Logging data sanitization** - Performance logs don't expose private information
- [ ] **Infrastructure monitoring security** - Monitoring endpoints properly secured
- [ ] **Performance alert security** - Alerts don't contain sensitive system information

## üß≠ PERFORMANCE ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

**‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Performance optimizations that compromise security or data integrity**
**‚úÖ MANDATORY: Wedding-optimized performance architecture with comprehensive monitoring**
