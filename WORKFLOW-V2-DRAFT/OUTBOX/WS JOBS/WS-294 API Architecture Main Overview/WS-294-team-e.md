# TEAM E - ROUND 1: WS-294 - API Architecture Main Overview
## 2025-09-03 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Create comprehensive testing strategy and documentation for API architecture with wedding-context validation and cross-platform integration testing
**FEATURE ID:** WS-294 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about API testing patterns, integration validation, documentation completeness, and wedding industry compliance

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **TEST SUITE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/api/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/api/api-architecture.test.ts | head -20
```

2. **TEST EXECUTION RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern=api
# MUST show: "All tests passing" with >90% coverage
```

3. **DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/docs/api/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/docs/api/WS-294-api-architecture-guide.md | head-20
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated testing implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## 📚 STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query existing testing patterns for API and integration validation
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("testing api integration validation middleware authentication");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("test describe beforeEach api", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/");
```

### B. TESTING & DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS (MANDATORY FOR QA WORK)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Load testing methodology and API documentation standards
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// Load existing API test patterns for consistency
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("jest react-testing-library playwright api testing patterns");
```

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation SPECIFIC to API testing and validation
mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("API testing patterns integration testing authentication middleware validation jest");
mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("wedding software API testing documentation compliance validation patterns");
```

## 🧠 STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPREHENSIVE API TESTING STRATEGY

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for API Testing Architecture Planning
```typescript
// Use for comprehensive API testing strategy development
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking({
  thought: "API testing for wedding software requires multiple layers: unit tests for individual endpoints, integration tests for middleware stack, contract tests for external service mocks, load tests for wedding season traffic, and end-to-end tests for complete wedding workflows across supplier and couple platforms",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 7
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Wedding industry compliance testing is critical - APIs must validate supplier data privacy, couple data protection, vendor communication security, and wedding day data integrity. Test scenarios must include real wedding workflows like venue booking, vendor coordination, and guest management",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 7
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Cross-team validation requires testing API consistency across Team A's documentation interface, Team B's backend implementation, Team C's integration layer, and Team D's performance optimizations. API contract testing ensures all teams implement the same specifications",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 7
});
```

## 🚀 STEP 2B: LAUNCH ENHANCED AGENTS WITH SPECIFIC MISSIONS
