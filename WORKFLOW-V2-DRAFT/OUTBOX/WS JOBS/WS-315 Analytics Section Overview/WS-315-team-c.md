## 📊 REAL WEDDING SCENARIO
**Integration Story:** "A wedding photographer wants their WedSync analytics to automatically sync with their existing business tools. When a client completes a journey milestone, it should update their CRM, trigger an email sequence in Mailchimp, create a task in their project management tool, and send a Slack notification to their assistant. All revenue data should sync with QuickBooks for accounting."
