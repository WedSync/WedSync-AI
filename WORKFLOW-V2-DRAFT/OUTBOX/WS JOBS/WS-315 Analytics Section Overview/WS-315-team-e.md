# TEAM E - ROUND 1: WS-315 - Analytics Section Overview
## 2025-01-22 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Create comprehensive testing suite, user documentation, and quality assurance for analytics system
**FEATURE ID:** WS-315 (Track all work with this ID)

## ðŸš¨ EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS
```bash
npm test -- --coverage analytics  # >90% coverage
npx playwright test analytics-workflows  # All E2E tests passing
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/docs/user-guides/analytics-guide.md
```

## ðŸŽ¯ TESTING & DOCUMENTATION FOCUS

## ðŸ“Š REAL WEDDING SCENARIO TESTING
**Testing User Story:** "Test that a busy wedding photographer can access accurate analytics during peak wedding season with 200+ active clients. Verify that dashboard loads quickly, metrics are accurate, exports work correctly, and mobile access functions properly even with poor venue WiFi. All calculations must match their actual business performance."

    it('should load dashboard with sample wedding data');
    it('should filter metrics by custom date ranges');
    it('should export reports in PDF and CSV formats');
    it('should update real-time when new events occur');
    it('should work correctly on mobile devices');
  });

  describe('Wedding Season Load Testing', () => {
    it('should handle 1000+ concurrent analytics dashboard views');
    it('should process 10,000+ events per minute during peak season');
    it('should maintain <2s response times under high load');
    it('should gracefully degrade performance when overloaded');
  });
