# TEAM B - ROUND 1: WS-304 - Supplier Dashboard Section Overview
## 2025-01-25 - 08:00 AM

**YOUR MISSION:** Build robust dashboard analytics API with real-time KPI calculations, business intelligence aggregation, and performance optimization for wedding vendor metrics
**FEATURE ID:** WS-304 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about real-time data aggregation, wedding business metrics calculation, and high-performance analytics queries

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/app/api/dashboard/supplier
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/app/api/dashboard/supplier/analytics/route.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test api/dashboard/supplier
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR ANALYTICS API

### Backend-Specific Sequential Thinking Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Wedding Business Analytics Strategy
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Supplier dashboard analytics need: Revenue calculation APIs with profit margin analysis, booking pipeline metrics with conversion rates, client satisfaction aggregation from feedback, seasonal trend analysis for wedding industry patterns, competitor benchmarking data, financial forecasting for business growth planning.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Real-time requirements: Live booking notifications affect revenue projections, client communication impacts satisfaction scores, weather changes affect outdoor wedding logistics, vendor collaboration updates influence service delivery metrics, payment status changes affect cash flow calculations.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Performance considerations: Complex aggregation queries on large wedding datasets, real-time calculations for thousands of concurrent vendor dashboards, caching strategies for expensive analytics operations, database optimization for time-series wedding data, efficient data fetching for mobile dashboard loading.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  numberJe: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Implementation strategy: Materialized views for pre-calculated metrics, Redis caching for frequently accessed analytics, background jobs for heavy computations, real-time websocket updates for live metrics, API rate limiting for expensive analytics endpoints.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```
