# TEAM A - ROUND 1: WS-240 - AI Cost Optimization System
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build intelligent frontend interface for AI cost optimization with real-time budget monitoring, smart caching visualization, and wedding season cost projections
**FEATURE ID:** WS-240 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about wedding season cost spikes (March-October 1.6x multiplier) and helping suppliers optimize AI costs without sacrificing quality

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/ai-optimization/
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/app/(dashboard)/ai-optimization/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/ai-optimization/CostOptimizationDashboard.tsx | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test ai-optimization
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

## 📚 STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION
```typescript
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("cost.*tracking|budget.*monitoring|optimization");
```

## 🧠 STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding suppliers face 75% higher AI costs during peak season (March-October). This system needs: 1) Real-time cost monitoring, 2) Smart caching to reduce API calls, 3) Model selection optimization (GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5), 4) Batch processing for efficiency, 5) Wedding season cost projections. Challenge: Make complex AI cost optimization simple for non-technical wedding vendors.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5
});
```

## 🎯 TEAM A SPECIALIZATION - FRONTEND/UI FOCUS:

### Core Cost Optimization UI Components:
- [ ] `CostOptimizationDashboard.tsx` - Main cost monitoring and control interface
- [ ] `WeddingSeasonCostProjector.tsx` - Seasonal cost forecasting (March-Oct peak)
- [ ] `SmartCachingVisualizer.tsx` - Show cache hit/miss rates and savings
- [ ] `BudgetAlertsManager.tsx` - Configurable budget alerts and auto-disable settings
- [ ] `ModelSelectionOptimizer.tsx` - Choose between GPT models based on cost/quality
- [ ] `BatchProcessingScheduler.tsx` - Schedule AI operations for off-peak cost savings
- [ ] `CostSavingsReporter.tsx` - Visual reports showing optimization effectiveness

### Wedding Industry Cost Scenarios:
- **Photography Studio "Capture Moments"**: Processing 15 weddings/month in June
  - 12,000 photo tags (AI vision): £240/month → £60/month with caching (75% savings)
  - 450 client emails (AI composition): £90/month → £22/month with optimization
  - Show real cost reduction from £380/month to £95/month

- **Venue Management**: Event descriptions and client communications
  - Peak season (June): 50 events × £8 AI cost = £400/month
  - With optimization: Smart caching + model selection = £120/month
  - 70% cost reduction during most expensive months

### Visual Cost Optimization Features:
- [ ] **Real-time Cost Meter**: Live spending tracker with wedding season multipliers
- [ ] **Savings Heatmap**: Visual representation of cache effectiveness
- [ ] **Budget Health Indicators**: Green/amber/red status with auto-disable warnings
- [ ] **Seasonal Cost Projections**: June peak season vs January baseline costs
- [ ] **Optimization Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions to reduce costs

## 🎯 SPECIFIC DELIVERABLES FOR ROUND 1

### Cost Monitoring Interface:
- [ ] Real-time daily/monthly cost tracking with wedding season context
- [ ] Budget alerts with customizable thresholds (80%, 90%, 100%)
- [ ] Auto-disable controls to prevent cost overruns
- [ ] Cost breakdown by AI feature type (photo AI, content generation, chatbot)

### Optimization Controls:
- [ ] Cache strategy configuration with hit/miss visualization
- [ ] Model selection interface (quality vs cost trade-offs)
- [ ] Batch processing scheduler for non-urgent operations
- [ ] Peak season optimization profiles

### Wedding Season Intelligence:
- [ ] March-October 1.6x cost multiplier warnings
- [ ] Seasonal budget recommendations based on booking volume
- [ ] Peak month preparation alerts and optimization suggestions
- [ ] Historical cost analysis for annual planning

## 🌟 WEDDING SUPPLIER COST OPTIMIZATION SUCCESS SCENARIOS

**Scenario 1**: Photography studio sees June costs projected at £400. System recommends enabling aggressive caching and using GPT-3.5 for routine tasks, reducing projected costs to £120 (70% savings) while maintaining quality for client deliverables.

**Scenario 2**: Venue coordinator gets budget alert at 80% of monthly limit. Dashboard shows cache hit rate of only 45% and suggests optimizing content templates, potentially saving £50/month with better caching strategy.
