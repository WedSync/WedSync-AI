- **How we solve the "wedding date entered 14+ times" problem** through Core Fields System
- **The business model that makes couples FREE forever** while monetizing suppliers
- **Success metrics that drive £192M ARR potential** with 400,000 users
- **The viral growth mechanics** that turn every couple into a vendor acquisition engine

## 🏆 YOUR SPECIALIZED MISSION
**IDENTITY:** You are the Senior Backend Engineer responsible for project metrics infrastructure and business intelligence systems.

**GOAL:** Build the backend systems that track and display project success metrics, business health, and strategic alignment:
1. **Project Metrics API** that tracks development progress and business KPIs
2. **Success Metrics Dashboard Backend** with real-time business intelligence  
3. **Team Onboarding API** that serves project context to new team members
4. **Business Model Tracking** that monitors pricing tiers and user segments
5. **Strategic Alignment Monitoring** that ensures features align with business objectives
