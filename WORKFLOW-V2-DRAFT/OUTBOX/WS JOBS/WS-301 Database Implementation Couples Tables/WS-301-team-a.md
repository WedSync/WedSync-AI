# TEAM A - ROUND 1: WS-301 - Database Implementation - Couples Tables
## 2025-01-22 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build comprehensive React UI components for couples database management with TypeScript
**FEATURE ID:** WS-301 (Track all work with this ID)  
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about wedding context and couples' user experience patterns

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/couples/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/couples/CoupleProfileManager.tsx | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test couples
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## üìö STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query specific areas relevant to couples database UI
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("couples profile form management");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("CoupleProfile", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/");
```

### B. UI STYLE GUIDES & TECHNOLOGY STACK (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Load the correct UI Style Guide
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");
```

**üö® CRITICAL UI TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
- **Untitled UI**: Primary component library (MANDATORY)
- **Magic UI**: Animations and visual enhancements (MANDATORY)
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.11**: Utility-first CSS
- **Lucide React**: Icons ONLY

**‚ùå DO NOT USE:**
- Radix UI, Catalyst UI, shadcn/ui, or any other component libraries

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Use Ref MCP to search for:
ref_search_documentation("React Hook Form couples profile validation patterns")
ref_search_documentation("Untitled UI form components advanced validation")
ref_search_documentation("Next.js app router couples data management")
ref_search_documentation("Zod schema wedding data validation")
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Frontend-Specific Sequential Thinking Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Complex Couples UI Architecture Analysis
```typescript
// Before building couples database UI components
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Couples database UI needs: partner profile management, core wedding fields auto-population forms, guest list management interface, supplier connection controls, task delegation system, timeline management, budget tracking (private), and wedding website integration. Each component has different interaction patterns and wedding-specific state management needs.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "State management analysis: Couple profile needs real-time partner synchronization, core wedding fields require auto-population across supplier forms, guest management needs drag-drop functionality, task delegation requires helper assignment flows. Consider using React Query for server state, local state for UI interactions.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Component architecture: CoupleProfileManager (both partners), CoreWeddingFieldsForm (auto-populates everywhere), GuestListManager (RSVP tracking), SupplierConnectionHub (permissions), TaskDelegationInterface (wedding party), TimelineBuilder (ceremony/reception), BudgetTracker (private data), WeddingWebsiteSettings.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding UX considerations: Engaged couples will use this on mobile while planning, during stressful wedding preparation periods. Need emotional design - congratulatory messaging, progress celebration, helper appreciation features, graceful error handling, and mobile-first responsive design with touch optimization.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Implementation strategy: Build reusable form components with Untitled UI, create wedding-themed validation messages, implement progressive disclosure for complex forms, use Magic UI for celebration animations, ensure accessibility for older family members, optimize for 3G networks at venues.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 5,
  totalThoughts: 5
});
```
