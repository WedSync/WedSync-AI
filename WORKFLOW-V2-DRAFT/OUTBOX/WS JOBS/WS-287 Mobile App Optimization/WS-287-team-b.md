# TEAM B - ROUND 1: WS-287 - Mobile App Optimization
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build mobile-optimized API architecture with offline sync, background processing, and mobile-specific endpoints
**FEATURE ID:** WS-287 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about mobile data patterns, offline capabilities, and battery-efficient processing

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/app/api/mobile/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/app/api/mobile/sync/route.ts | head -20
```

## üß† SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Mobile API Architecture Strategy
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Mobile API optimization requires: Lightweight response formats (GraphQL or minimal REST), offline-first sync patterns with conflict resolution, background job processing for large operations, mobile-specific endpoints (reduced payloads), batch operations for efficiency, delta sync for data updates, compression for slow networks.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding mobile data patterns: Vendor coordination requires real-time messaging APIs, photo uploads need chunked/resumable uploads, timeline updates need optimistic UI support, guest management needs bulk operations, vendor scheduling needs conflict detection, payment processing needs secure mobile flows.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Offline sync architecture: Event sourcing for offline actions, conflict resolution algorithms (last-write-wins vs operational transforms), background sync queues, connection state management, cache invalidation strategies, optimistic updates with rollback capabilities.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Mobile performance APIs: Response compression with gzip/brotli, lazy loading endpoints, pagination optimization, image optimization APIs, background processing for heavy operations, webhook delivery optimization, rate limiting for mobile clients, battery-efficient polling strategies.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```
