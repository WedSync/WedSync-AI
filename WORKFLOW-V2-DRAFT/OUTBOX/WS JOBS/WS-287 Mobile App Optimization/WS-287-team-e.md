# TEAM E - ROUND 1: WS-287 - Mobile App Optimization
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Create comprehensive mobile testing and documentation with >95% coverage and cross-device validation
**FEATURE ID:** WS-287 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about mobile performance validation and comprehensive device testing

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/__tests__/mobile/app-optimization/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/__tests__/mobile/app-optimization/MobileApp.comprehensive.test.tsx | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test mobile-optimization
# MUST show: "All tests passing with >95% coverage"
```

## 🧠 SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Mobile Optimization Testing Strategy
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Mobile optimization testing requires: Cross-device performance validation, offline functionality testing, touch interaction accuracy, PWA feature verification, native integration testing, battery usage optimization validation, network condition simulation, accessibility compliance on mobile.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Device-specific testing scenarios: iPhone SE (smallest screen) to iPad Pro (largest), Android fragmentation across manufacturers, different iOS/Android versions, various screen densities and orientations, notch and dynamic island handling, home indicator considerations, gesture navigation compatibility.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding mobile workflows testing: Venue connectivity issues during setup, photo uploads on slow networks, timeline updates during wedding day chaos, emergency contact access under stress, offline guest check-ins, payment processing in poor signal areas, vendor coordination in real-time.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Performance optimization validation: Bundle size optimization for mobile networks, lazy loading effectiveness, service worker caching accuracy, background sync reliability, battery usage profiling, memory leak detection, animation performance on lower-end devices.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Mobile documentation needs: Device compatibility matrix, performance optimization guides, offline functionality documentation, native feature integration guides, troubleshooting for mobile-specific issues, best practices for wedding mobile workflows, accessibility guidelines for mobile wedding apps.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 5,
  totalThoughts: 5
});
