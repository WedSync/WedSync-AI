# TEAM A - ROUND 1: WS-287 - Mobile App Optimization
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build native mobile experience with progressive web app features and offline wedding management
**FEATURE ID:** WS-287 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about mobile-first wedding workflows and app-like performance

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/mobile/app-optimization/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/mobile/app-optimization/MobileAppShell.tsx | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test mobile-app-optimization
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

## üß† SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Mobile App Optimization Architecture
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Mobile app optimization requires: PWA app shell architecture, offline-first data synchronization, native mobile gestures and animations, bottom navigation for thumb reach, swipe-based interactions, pull-to-refresh functionality, background sync capabilities, push notification system.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding mobile workflows: On-site vendor management during wedding setup, offline photo uploads from venue, real-time timeline updates during wedding day, guest check-in system with QR codes, emergency contact access, vendor coordination messaging, timeline adjustments in real-time.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Performance optimization: Code splitting for mobile bundles, lazy loading of non-critical components, image optimization with WebP/AVIF, service worker caching strategies, background sync for form submissions, local storage optimization, battery-efficient animations.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Native app features: Add to home screen prompts, native sharing capabilities, camera integration for photos, location services for venues, biometric authentication, native notifications, accelerometer for gesture controls, haptic feedback for interactions.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```
