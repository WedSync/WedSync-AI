**YOUR MISSION:** Build mobile app integration ecosystem with CRM sync, calendar integration, and mobile payment processing
**FEATURE ID:** WS-287 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about mobile integration patterns and seamless third-party connectivity

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/integrations/mobile/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/integrations/mobile/MobileIntegrationOrchestrator.ts | head -20
```

## üß† SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Mobile Integration Architecture
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Mobile integration optimization requires: Native calendar sync (iOS/Android), CRM data synchronization for offline access, mobile payment processing with Apple Pay/Google Pay, contact integration for vendor management, photo library access for portfolio updates, location services for venue check-ins, push notification integration across platforms.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding mobile integrations: Photographer needs Tave/Light Blue sync on mobile, venue managers need calendar integration for booking management, coordinators need real-time vendor communication, couples need shared photo access, vendors need payment processing on-site, timeline sync across all wedding stakeholders.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Mobile-first integration patterns: Background sync with retry mechanisms, offline-first data storage with eventual consistency, mobile OAuth flows for secure authentication, app-to-app communication for workflow handoffs, native sharing capabilities, deep linking for seamless navigation.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Performance and reliability: Connection state monitoring, graceful degradation for poor connectivity, efficient data compression, battery-optimized sync schedules, error handling with user feedback, integration health monitoring, fallback strategies for failed connections.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```
