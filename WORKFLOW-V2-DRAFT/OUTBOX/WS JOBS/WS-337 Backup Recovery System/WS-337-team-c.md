# TEAM C - ROUND 1: WS-337 - Backup Recovery System
## 2025-01-22 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build comprehensive backup integrations with cloud storage providers (AWS S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud), CDN backup distribution, and multi-region disaster recovery
**FEATURE ID:** WS-337 (Track all work with this ID)

## ðŸŽ¯ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION - BACKUP INTEGRATION SERVICES

### CORE INTEGRATION SERVICES TO IMPLEMENT

#### 1. Multi-Cloud Backup Distribution
```typescript
// src/lib/integrations/backup/multi-cloud-backup.ts
export class MultiCloudBackupService {
  async distributeBackup(backupData: BackupSnapshot): Promise<DistributionResult> {
    // Distribute wedding backups across multiple cloud providers
    // Primary: AWS S3, Secondary: Azure Blob, Tertiary: Google Cloud
    // Ensure geographic distribution for disaster recovery
  }

  async performCrossPlatformValidation(backupId: string): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    // Validate backup integrity across all storage providers
    // Verify data consistency and accessibility
    // Check for provider-specific corruption issues
  }
}
```

#### 2. Real-time Backup Synchronization
```typescript
// src/lib/integrations/backup/realtime-sync.ts
export class RealtimeBackupSync {
  async streamWeddingDataChanges(weddingId: string): Promise<void> {
    // Real-time streaming of critical wedding data changes
    // Immediate backup of guest list updates during wedding day
    // Stream photo uploads to multiple backup locations
  }

  async handleSyncFailures(syncError: SyncError): Promise<RecoveryAction> {
    // Implement failover mechanisms when primary backup fails
    // Switch to secondary backup providers automatically
    // Queue failed operations for retry with exponential backoff
  }
}
```
