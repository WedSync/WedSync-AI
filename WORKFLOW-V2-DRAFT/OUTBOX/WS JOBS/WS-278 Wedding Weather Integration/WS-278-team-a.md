# TEAM A - ROUND 1: WS-278 - Wedding Weather Integration
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build comprehensive frontend UI for wedding weather monitoring and contingency planning
**FEATURE ID:** WS-278 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about outdoor wedding concerns and weather-based decision making

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/weather/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/weather/WeatherDashboard.tsx | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test weather
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## üìö STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query weather and event planning patterns
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("weather forecast alerts timeline event");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("WeatherService AlertSystem Timeline", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/components/events/");
```

### B. UI STYLE GUIDES & TECHNOLOGY STACK (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Load the correct UI Style Guide
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");
```

**üö® CRITICAL UI TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
- **Untitled UI**: Primary component library (MANDATORY)
- **Magic UI**: Animations and visual enhancements (MANDATORY)
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.11**: Utility-first CSS
- **Lucide React**: Icons ONLY

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation SPECIFIC to weather integration
# Use Ref MCP to search for:
# - "React weather widget components"
# - "Chart.js weather data visualization"
# - "API integration patterns weather data"
# - "Responsive weather dashboard design"
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR WEATHER SYSTEM DESIGN

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Weather Integration
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding weather integration needs: Real-time weather monitoring for wedding venue locations, 7-day and hourly forecasts for planning, severe weather alerts and notifications, contingency plan activation based on weather conditions, vendor notification system for weather changes, guest communication for weather-related updates.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "UI complexity analysis: Weather dashboard with current conditions and forecasts, alert system with different urgency levels, contingency plan interface with automatic suggestions, vendor notification controls, guest communication tools, historical weather data for venue insights.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding weather scenarios: Outdoor ceremony rain contingency, tent setup wind alerts, photography lighting concerns, guest comfort temperature warnings, vendor logistics weather impacts, timeline adjustments based on weather forecasts.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Implementation strategy: Weather API integration with real-time updates, visual weather cards with actionable insights, automated alert system with customizable thresholds, contingency plan templates, communication automation, mobile-optimized weather monitoring.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

## üöÄ STEP 2B: LAUNCH ENHANCED AGENTS WITH SPECIFIC MISSIONS
