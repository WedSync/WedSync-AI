## ðŸ’• REAL WEDDING TESTING SCENARIO
**Testing User Story:** "Test that a couple (Sarah and Tom) can successfully invite and connect with 6 different wedding vendors (photographer, venue, caterer, florist, DJ, wedding planner), coordinate a unified wedding timeline, communicate with all vendors through the platform, share guest information appropriately, build their wedding website, and access all critical information on their mobile devices during their actual wedding day. Verify all vendor data remains synchronized, privacy settings are respected, and emergency coordination works flawlessly."
