# TEAM E - WS-267 File Upload Optimization QA & Documentation
## Upload Performance Testing & Wedding File Management Guide

**FEATURE ID**: WS-267  
**TEAM**: E (QA/Testing & Documentation)  
**SPRINT**: Round 1  

### 🎯 WEDDING USER STORY

**As a wedding platform QA engineer**, I need comprehensive file upload testing that simulates realistic wedding scenarios including massive photo galleries, poor venue connectivity, and simultaneous uploads from multiple photographers, ensuring our upload system never fails during couples' precious moment capture and sharing.

### 🏗️ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

Build **Comprehensive Upload Testing & Documentation** covering wedding file scenarios, performance validation, and user guidance.

### 🧪 WEDDING FILE UPLOAD TESTS

**Wedding Photo Gallery Upload Simulation:**
```typescript
describe('WS-267 Wedding File Upload Performance Fortress', () => {
    test('Handles massive wedding photo gallery upload during reception', async () => {
        const weddingPhotoScenario = await createWeddingPhotoUploadScenario({
            photographers: 3,
            photos_per_photographer: 200,
            file_sizes: ['2MB', '5MB', '8MB'],
            upload_duration: '30 minutes',
            venue_network_quality: 'poor'
        });
        
        const uploadResults = await simulateWeddingPhotoUpload(weddingPhotoScenario);
        
        expect(uploadResults.success_rate).toBeGreaterThan(98);
        expect(uploadResults.average_upload_time).toBeLessThan(3000); // <3 seconds per photo
        expect(uploadResults.compression_quality).toBeGreaterThan(95);
        expect(uploadResults.failed_uploads_recovered).toBe(100); // 100% recovery
        expect(uploadResults.mobile_compatibility).toBe(true);
    });
    
    test('Recovers gracefully from venue network interruptions', async () => {
        const networkInterruptionScenario = await simulateVenueNetworkIssues({
            active_uploads: 50,
            interruption_type: 'complete_network_loss',
            interruption_duration: '2 minutes',
            expected_recovery: 'automatic_resume'
        });
        
        const recoveryResults = await validateUploadRecovery(networkInterruptionScenario);
        
        expect(recoveryResults.uploads_lost).toBe(0);
        expect(recoveryResults.automatic_resume_rate).toBe(100);
        expect(recoveryResults.user_notification_clarity).toBe(true);
    });
});
```

## Optimal Upload Strategies for Wedding Day

### Photo Upload Best Practices
1. **Batch Size**: Upload 20-50 photos per batch for optimal performance
2. **File Preparation**: Use JPEG format, 2-8MB per photo for best results
3. **Mobile Uploads**: Use our mobile app for instant venue uploads
4. **Quality Settings**: Choose "Wedding Quality" preset for optimal compression

### Venue Network Challenges
- **Poor WiFi**: Photos queue automatically, upload when connection improves
- **Mobile Hotspot**: Switch to mobile data if venue WiFi is unreliable
- **Offline Mode**: Photos save locally, sync when connection returns
- **Battery Optimization**: Enable "Wedding Day Mode" to conserve battery

### Emergency Upload Procedures
1. **Connection Lost**: Don't panic - uploads will resume automatically
2. **Storage Full**: Clear phone storage, uploads will retry automatically
3. **Upload Failures**: Check network, retry button will appear for failed photos
4. **Urgent Sharing**: Use "Priority Upload" for must-share moments
```

### ✅ COMPLETION CRITERIA

**Must Deliver:**
1. **Comprehensive upload testing** covering all wedding file scenarios
2. **Performance validation** ensuring consistent upload speeds under load
3. **Network resilience testing** validating recovery from venue connectivity issues
4. **User documentation** guiding photographers and couples through upload process
5. **Mobile compatibility testing** across all devices used at wedding venues

**Evidence Required:**
```bash
npm run test:file-upload-comprehensive
# Must show: "All wedding upload scenarios testing successfully"
```
