# TEAM D - WS-267 File Upload Optimization Performance & Infrastructure
## Ultra-High-Performance File Upload Infrastructure

**FEATURE ID**: WS-267  
**TEAM**: D (Performance/Infrastructure)  
**SPRINT**: Round 1  

### üéØ WEDDING USER STORY

**As a wedding platform infrastructure engineer**, I need ultra-high-performance file upload infrastructure that can handle 1000+ simultaneous wedding photo uploads with parallel processing, intelligent compression, and sub-second response times, ensuring photographers can instantly share couples' precious moments without technical delays.

### üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

Build **High-Performance Upload Infrastructure** with parallel processing, intelligent compression, and wedding traffic optimization.

### ‚ö° ULTRA-FAST UPLOAD ARCHITECTURE

**Parallel Upload Processing:**
```typescript
class HighPerformanceUploadProcessor {
    private uploadWorkers: WorkerPool;
    private compressionEngine: CompressionEngine;
    
    async processParallelUploads(files: FileUpload[]): Promise<ProcessingResults> {
        // Chunk files for optimal processing
        const chunks = this.createOptimalChunks(files);
        
        // Parallel processing with worker pools
        const results = await Promise.all(
            chunks.map(chunk => this.processChunkInParallel(chunk))
        );
        
        return this.aggregateResults(results);
    }
    
    private async processChunkInParallel(chunk: FileChunk): Promise<ChunkResult> {
        return await this.uploadWorkers.execute({
            files: chunk.files,
            optimization: 'wedding_photo_optimized',
            priority: chunk.weddingContext.priority
        });
    }
}
```

### üöÄ WEDDING PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

**Performance Targets:**
```typescript
const WEDDING_UPLOAD_PERFORMANCE = {
    PROCESSING_SPEED: {
        single_photo: "<2 seconds for 5MB wedding photo",
        batch_upload: "<30 seconds for 100 wedding photos",
        large_gallery: "<5 minutes for 500+ photo wedding gallery"
    },
    COMPRESSION_EFFICIENCY: {
        quality_retention: "95% visual quality maintained",
        size_reduction: "70% average file size reduction",
        processing_speed: "Real-time compression during upload"
    }
};
```

### ‚úÖ COMPLETION CRITERIA

**Must Deliver:**
1. **Sub-second upload processing** for individual wedding photos
2. **Parallel processing architecture** handling 1000+ simultaneous uploads
3. **Intelligent compression** maintaining 95% visual quality
4. **Auto-scaling infrastructure** responding to wedding traffic patterns
5. **Performance monitoring** ensuring consistent upload speeds

**Evidence Required:**
```bash
npm run load-test:file-upload-performance
# Must show: "1000+ concurrent uploads with <2s processing time"
```
