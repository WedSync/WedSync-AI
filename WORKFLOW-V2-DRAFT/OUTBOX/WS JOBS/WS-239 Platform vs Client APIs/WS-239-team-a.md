# TEAM A - ROUND 1: WS-239 - Platform vs Client APIs Implementation
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Create intuitive frontend interface for AI feature management, clearly distinguishing platform-provided vs client-managed AI features with transparent cost tracking
**FEATURE ID:** WS-239 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about creating clear visual distinctions between free/included AI features vs premium client-managed features

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/ai-features/
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/app/(dashboard)/ai-features/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/ai-features/AIFeatureManager.tsx | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test ai-features
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

## 📚 STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("ai.*feature|subscription.*tier|billing.*component");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("SubscriptionTier", "", true);
```

### B. UI STYLE GUIDES & TECHNOLOGY STACK (MANDATORY)
```typescript
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");
```

## 🧠 STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This AI feature system needs clear visual separation between platform features (included in subscription) vs client features (requires own API key). Wedding suppliers need to understand: 1) What's included in their tier, 2) How to upgrade to client-managed features, 3) Real-time cost tracking, 4) Easy API key setup. The challenge is making complex AI billing transparent and user-friendly.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

## 🔒 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE!)

### FRONTEND SECURITY CHECKLIST:
- [ ] **API key input sanitization** - Secure handling of user-provided API keys
- [ ] **Cost data encryption** - Encrypt sensitive usage/cost information in UI
- [ ] **Feature access validation** - Client-side validation of subscription tiers
- [ ] **Usage data privacy** - Protect AI usage patterns and costs
- [ ] **Secure API key storage** - Never expose full API keys in frontend

## 🌟 WEDDING SUPPLIER SUCCESS SCENARIOS

**Scenario 1**: Wedding photographer Sarah sees her Professional tier includes 1,000 AI photo tags/month. The interface clearly shows she's used 800 tags and suggests upgrading to client-managed for unlimited tagging during peak season.

**Scenario 2**: Venue coordinator Mike wants advanced AI description generation. The wizard walks him through adding his OpenAI API key, tests the connection, and shows projected monthly costs based on his venue booking volume.
