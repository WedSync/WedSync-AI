# TEAM E - ROUND 1: WS-239 - Platform vs Client APIs Implementation
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Comprehensive quality assurance, testing, and documentation for dual AI system architecture with focus on migration testing, cost accuracy validation, and wedding supplier workflow verification
**FEATURE ID:** WS-239 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about testing complex AI provider switching, validating cost calculations, and ensuring wedding suppliers never lose AI functionality during transitions

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/ai-features/dual-system/
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/playwright-tests/ai-features/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/ai-features/dual-system/migration-testing.test.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test ai-features
npm run test:e2e ai-features
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

## 📚 STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("test.*ai|migration.*test|billing.*test");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("describe", "", true);
```

### B. TESTING FRAMEWORKS & AI PATTERNS (MANDATORY)
```typescript
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/playwright.config.ts");
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/setup.ts");
```

## 🧠 STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Testing dual AI system requires: 1) Migration testing without service interruption, 2) Cost calculation accuracy across platform vs client systems, 3) API key validation and rotation testing, 4) Failover testing when providers go down, 5) Wedding season load testing, 6) Mobile offline functionality testing. Challenge: Mocking multiple AI providers while maintaining realistic test scenarios that match actual wedding supplier workflows.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 7
});
```

## 🌟 WEDDING INDUSTRY TESTING SUCCESS SCENARIOS

**Test Scenario 1**: Photography studio "Capture Moments" approaches platform limit (950/1000 photo tags) during peak June season. Test validates seamless migration to client system, maintains photo processing quality, tracks cost savings (£240→£60/month), and provides accurate billing.

**Test Scenario 2**: Venue coordinator's personal OpenAI account experiences 30-second outage. Test validates automatic failover to platform system, maintains event description generation, logs the incident, switches back when client system recovers - all transparent to user.

**Test Scenario 3**: Wedding planner migrates 50 client accounts from platform to client AI. Load test validates system handles bulk migration, maintains service for all accounts, preserves cost history, and provides accurate migration summary reporting.
