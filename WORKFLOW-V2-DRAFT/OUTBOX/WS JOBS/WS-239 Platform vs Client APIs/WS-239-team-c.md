# TEAM C - ROUND 1: WS-239 - Platform vs Client APIs Implementation
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Build comprehensive integration layer managing multiple AI providers, seamless migration between platform/client systems, and third-party service health monitoring
**FEATURE ID:** WS-239 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about graceful failover between AI systems, secure API key rotation, and maintaining wedding supplier workflows during system transitions

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/integrations/ai-providers/
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/integrations/migration/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/integrations/ai-providers/AIProviderManager.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test integrations/ai-providers
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

## üìö STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("integration.*service|ai.*provider|migration.*service");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("OpenAIService", "", true);
```

### B. INTEGRATION PATTERNS & AI SERVICES (MANDATORY)
```typescript
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/integrations/NotificationService.ts");
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/ai/openai-client.ts");
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "AI provider integration complexity: 1) Platform AI (WedSync's OpenAI keys) vs Client AI (supplier keys), 2) Seamless migration without service interruption, 3) Health monitoring for both systems, 4) Failover handling when one provider fails, 5) Wedding season scaling (March-Oct peak). Challenge: Maintaining consistent AI service quality while managing dual provider architecture and supplier-specific configurations.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 6
});
```

    request: PlatformAIRequest
  ): Promise<PlatformAIResponse>;
  
  trackPlatformUsage(
    supplierId: string,
    usage: UsageMetrics
  ): Promise<void>;
  
  // Client AI integration (Supplier's keys)
  executeClientRequest(
    request: ClientAIRequest,
    supplierApiKey: string
  ): Promise<ClientAIResponse>;
  
  validateClientProvider(
    provider: AIProvider,
    apiKey: string
  ): Promise<ValidationResult>;
  
  // Seamless switching
  switchProvider(
    supplierId: string,
    fromProvider: AIProvider,
    toProvider: AIProvider
  ): Promise<SwitchResult>;
}
```

**3. Migration and Transition Service:**
```typescript
interface AIFeatureMigrationService {
  planMigration(
    supplierId: string,
    targetConfig: AIConfig
  ): Promise<MigrationPlan>;
  
  executeMigration(
    migrationPlan: MigrationPlan
  ): Promise<MigrationResult>;
  
  rollbackMigration(
    migrationId: string

## üåü WEDDING SUPPLIER INTEGRATION SUCCESS SCENARIOS

**Scenario 1**: Photography studio "Capture Moments" reaches platform limits during June peak season. Integration service seamlessly migrates them to client system, validates their OpenAI key, and continues photo tagging without interruption - all transparent to their workflow.

**Scenario 2**: Venue coordinator's personal OpenAI account experiences outage. Health monitor detects failure, integration service automatically falls back to platform system temporarily while their provider recovers, maintaining their event description generation.

**Scenario 3**: Wedding planner wants to test client AI before fully migrating. Integration service runs parallel requests to both systems, compares results and costs, then provides migration recommendation based on their timeline management usage patterns.
