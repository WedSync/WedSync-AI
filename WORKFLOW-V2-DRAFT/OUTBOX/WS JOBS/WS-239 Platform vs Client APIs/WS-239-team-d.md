## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/wedme/ai-features/

cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/wedme/ai-features/MobileAIFeatureManager.tsx | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Mobile AI feature management needs: 1) Simple platform vs client toggle for non-technical wedding suppliers, 2) Mobile-friendly API key entry with validation, 3) Real-time cost monitoring during events, 4) Offline capability for venue visits, 5) Touch-optimized interface for photographers/planners on-the-go.

## üåü WEDDING SUPPLIER MOBILE SUCCESS SCENARIOS

**Scenario 1**: Wedding photographer Sarah is at a venue with poor wifi. She uses the mobile app to check her platform AI photo tagging limits (850/1000), sees she's approaching the limit, and switches to client AI mode using her cached OpenAI key - all working offline until sync.

**Scenario 2**: Venue coordinator Mike is meeting with a couple and wants to generate AI descriptions for their space. The mobile interface shows his client AI is down, automatically falls back to platform AI, and generates descriptions seamlessly while tracking costs in real-time.

**Scenario 3**: Wedding planner Lisa is at a tasting and needs to enable menu AI features for the caterer. She uses the mobile migration wizard to help them set up client AI, validates their API key via mobile, and shows cost projections for their catering volume.
