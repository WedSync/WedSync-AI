# TEAM A - WS-262 Security Audit System UI Dashboard
## Wedding Data Protection & Admin Security Interface

**FEATURE ID**: WS-262  
**TEAM**: A (Frontend/UI)  
**SPRINT**: Round 1  

### 🎯 WEDDING USER STORY

**As a wedding platform security administrator managing 5000+ couples' most precious data**, I need an ultra-secure audit dashboard that requires biometric verification, two-factor authentication, and role-based access controls, so I can monitor all security events without creating any new vulnerabilities that could expose couples' private wedding information to unauthorized users.

**As a wedding coordinator who needs to access security logs during an emergency**, I need a mobile-responsive security dashboard that works on my iPhone even at remote venues, so I can quickly identify if any security incidents affect my couples' weddings and escalate appropriately.

### 🏗️ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

Build a **Ultra-Secure Admin Security Dashboard** with military-grade authentication, real-time security monitoring, and wedding-data-aware access controls.

**Core UI Components Needed:**
- Multi-factor authentication interface with biometric support
- Real-time security event monitoring dashboard
- Wedding data access audit trails with couple privacy protection
- Role-based security administration with granular permissions
- Security incident response interface for emergency coordination
- Mobile-first security monitoring for venue-based access

### 🔒 ULTRA-SECURITY UI REQUIREMENTS

**Biometric Authentication Interface:**
```typescript
// Ultra-secure login flow for security admins
const SecurityAdminLogin = {
    biometric_verification: "Fingerprint + Face ID required",
    two_factor_auth: "TOTP + SMS backup",
    session_duration: "15 minutes maximum",
    location_verification: "IP geolocation + device fingerprinting",
    audit_all_attempts: "Log every login attempt with full context"
};
```

**Wedding Data Protection UI:**
```typescript
// All wedding data must be masked/protected in security dashboard
const WeddingDataProtection = {
    couple_names: "Display as 'Couple #12345' only",
    guest_lists: "Show count only, never names",
    vendor_details: "Mask contact info, show roles only",
    financial_data: "Aggregate amounts only, no individual transactions",
    photo_previews: "Thumbnails only with blur overlay"
};
```

**Security Event Categories:**
```typescript
const SECURITY_EVENT_TYPES = {
    P0_CRITICAL: {
        color: "red-600",
        examples: ["Unauthorized admin access", "Wedding data breach", "Payment fraud"],
        notification: "Immediate alerts + phone calls",
        escalation: "CTO + Legal team"
    },
    P1_HIGH: {
        color: "orange-500", 
        examples: ["Failed admin logins", "Suspicious API usage", "Mass data exports"],

        examples: ["Unusual login patterns", "API rate limit hits", "Form validation failures"],
        notification: "Dashboard notifications",
        escalation: "Daily review"
    }
};
```

### 📱 MOBILE SECURITY DASHBOARD

**Emergency Mobile Interface:**
```typescript
// Security dashboard optimized for emergency venue access
const MobileSecurityDashboard = {
    login_method: "Biometric only (faster than passwords)",
    critical_alerts_only: "Filter non-essential events on mobile",
    one_tap_escalation: "Direct call/SMS to security team",
    offline_capability: "Cache last 100 security events",
    battery_optimization: "Low-power mode for all-day monitoring"
};
```

**Touch-Optimized Security Controls:**
```typescript
const MOBILE_SECURITY_CONTROLS = {
    emergency_lockdown: "Large red button - 60px height",
    incident_response: "Quick action buttons for common responses",
    escalation_contacts: "One-tap calling for security team",
    status_indicators: "Large visual indicators for system health",
    audit_search: "Voice search for finding specific events"
};
```

### 🎨 UI SECURITY DESIGN PRINCIPLES

**Visual Security Indicators:**
- **Green Shield**: All systems secure, no active threats
- **Yellow Warning**: Potential security issues detected
- **Red Alert**: Critical security incident requiring immediate action
- **Blue Info**: Routine security events and maintenance

**Admin Role-Based UI:**
```typescript
const ADMIN_ROLE_UI_ACCESS = {
    SUPER_ADMIN: {
        view: "All security events + system configuration",
        color_theme: "red-accent", // Highest privilege indicator
        features: ["User management", "System settings", "Emergency controls"]
    },
    SECURITY_ADMIN: {
        view: "Security events + incident response", 
        color_theme: "orange-accent",
        features: ["Incident response", "Audit logs", "User monitoring"]
    },
    WEDDING_OPS_MANAGER: {
        view: "Wedding-related security events only",
        color_theme: "blue-accent", 
        features: ["Wedding security monitoring", "Vendor access logs"]
    },
    READ_ONLY_AUDITOR: {
        view: "Read-only access to all logs",
        color_theme: "gray-accent",
        features: ["Log viewing", "Report generation"]
    }
};
```

**Wedding Industry Security Context:**
```typescript
const WEDDING_SECURITY_CONTEXT = {
    peak_attack_times: "Friday evenings + Saturday mornings (wedding prep)",
    vulnerable_data_types: ["Guest lists", "Vendor payments", "Photo uploads"],
    high_risk_events: ["Saturday weddings", "Holiday weekends", "Summer season"],
    critical_protection: "Never display real couple names in security logs"
};
```

### 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

**React Security Components:**
```typescript
// Ultra-secure component architecture
const SecurityComponentStructure = {
    SecureAuthWrapper: "Wraps entire security dashboard",
    BiometricLogin: "Multi-factor authentication component", 
    SecurityEventStream: "Real-time security event display",
    IncidentResponsePanel: "Emergency response controls",
    AuditTrailViewer: "Wedding-data-aware log viewer",
    RoleBasedAccessGate: "Granular permission checking",
    MobileSecurityShield: "Mobile-optimized security interface"
};
```

**Real-Time Security Monitoring:**
```typescript
// WebSocket connection for live security events
const useSecurityEventStream = () => {
    const [events, setEvents] = useState([]);
    const [connectionStatus, setConnectionStatus] = useState('connecting');
    
    useEffect(() => {
        const ws = new WebSocket('/api/security/events/stream');
        
        ws.onmessage = (event) => {
            const securityEvent = JSON.parse(event.data);
            
            // Always mask wedding data in UI
            const maskedEvent = maskWeddingData(securityEvent);
            
            setEvents(prev => [maskedEvent, ...prev.slice(0, 99)]); // Keep last 100
            
            // Alert for critical events
            if (securityEvent.severity === 'P0_CRITICAL') {
                triggerEmergencyAlert(maskedEvent);
            }
        };
        
        return () => ws.close();
    }, []);
    
    return { events, connectionStatus };
};
```

**Wedding Data Masking:**
```typescript
// Never expose real wedding data in security dashboard
const maskWeddingData = (event) => {
    return {
        ...event,
        couple_names: event.couple_id ? `Couple #${event.couple_id}` : null,
        guest_count: event.guest_list?.length || 0, // Count only
        vendor_name: event.vendor_id ? `Vendor #${event.vendor_id}` : null,
        photo_count: event.photos?.length || 0,
        transaction_amount: event.amount ? 'MASKED' : null
    };
};
```

### 🚨 WEDDING DAY SECURITY PROTOCOLS

**Saturday Wedding Protection UI:**
```typescript
const SaturdaySecurityMode = {
    enhanced_monitoring: "Extra vigilance on all wedding-related events",
    reduced_admin_access: "Only emergency security functions available",
    wedding_context_alerts: "All alerts include active wedding impact",
    rapid_response_ui: "Streamlined interface for quick incident response",
    couple_notification_controls: "One-click communication to affected couples"
};
```

**Emergency Response Interface:**
```typescript
const EmergencySecurityControls = {
    system_lockdown: "Immediate read-only mode for all users",
    wedding_protection_mode: "Isolate wedding data from potential threats",
    incident_communication: "Pre-written templates for couple notifications", 
    expert_escalation: "Direct contact to external security experts",
    evidence_preservation: "Automatic backup of security logs"
};
```
