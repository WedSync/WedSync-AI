# TEAM E - WS-262 Security Audit System QA & Documentation
## Comprehensive Security Testing & Wedding Industry Security Playbooks

**FEATURE ID**: WS-262  
**TEAM**: E (QA/Testing & Documentation)  
**SPRINT**: Round 1  

### 🎯 WEDDING USER STORY

**As a wedding platform QA security engineer**, I need comprehensive security testing suites that validate our ultra-secure audit system can withstand sophisticated attacks targeting couples' precious wedding data, so I can guarantee that no unauthorized person can ever access guest lists, vendor information, or payment details during the most important day of couples' lives.

**As a wedding coordinator who might face a security incident during a Saturday wedding**, I need clear, step-by-step security playbooks that explain exactly what to do if we detect suspicious activity, how to protect couples' data, who to contact immediately, and how to communicate with couples if their wedding information is at risk.

### 🏗️ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

Build **Comprehensive Security Testing & Wedding Industry Documentation** for the security audit system, focusing on penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and emergency response procedures.

**Core QA Focus:**
- Penetration testing against wedding industry attack vectors
- Security audit system reliability validation under extreme load
- Vulnerability assessment for wedding data protection mechanisms
- Authentication bypass testing with multi-factor authentication
- Emergency response procedure testing and documentation

### 📚 WEDDING INDUSTRY SECURITY DOCUMENTATION

**Wedding Day Security Emergency Playbook:**
```markdown
# WEDDING DAY SECURITY EMERGENCY PLAYBOOK

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE SECURITY RESPONSE (0-30 SECONDS)

### SCENARIO: Security breach detected during active wedding

1. **ASSESS WEDDING IMPACT IMMEDIATELY**
   - Check active weddings dashboard: `/security/active-weddings-status`
   - Identify affected couples: Look for red security indicators
   - Determine data at risk: Guest lists, payments, photos, vendor contacts

2. **EMERGENCY SECURITY TRIAGE**
   - **0-1 couples affected**: Standard security response, monitor closely
   - **2-5 couples affected**: Escalate to security team lead + wedding ops
   - **5+ couples affected**: WEDDING SECURITY EMERGENCY - all hands response

3. **IMMEDIATE SECURITY ACTIONS**
   - Activate emergency security lockdown: Big red button in admin panel
   - Enable forensic logging mode: Preserve all evidence automatically
   - Alert affected wedding coordinators: Automated SMS/call system
   - Prepare couple communication templates: Pre-approved legal language

## 🛡️ SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE PROCEDURES

### Step 1: Immediate Containment (0-2 minutes)
1. **Activate Security Lockdown**
   - Access admin panel: `/security/emergency-controls`
   - Click "Emergency Security Lockdown" (requires two-factor auth)
   - Verify all wedding data access is now restricted
   
2. **Preserve Forensic Evidence**
   - Enable maximum audit logging: All database queries logged
   - Take system snapshots: Automated backup of current state
   - Lock affected user accounts: Prevent further unauthorized access
   
3. **Assess Scope of Breach**
   - Run security assessment report: `/security/breach-assessment`
   - Identify compromised data: Guest lists, payments, photos, contacts
   - Determine timeline: When did breach begin and end?

### Step 2: Wedding Impact Assessment (2-5 minutes)
1. **Identify Affected Weddings**
   - Query affected couples: Run database query for impacted weddings
   - Check wedding dates: Prioritize weddings happening today/tomorrow
   - Assess data sensitivity: Guest lists > photos > vendor info > payments

2. **Calculate Legal Exposure**
   - GDPR breach notification requirement: >72 hours if high risk
   - Couple notification requirement: Immediate if sensitive data exposed
   - Regulatory reporting: Determine if authorities must be notified

### Step 3: Couple Communication (5-15 minutes)
1. **Wedding Coordinators First**
   - Call coordinators of affected weddings: Use emergency contact list
   - Provide security incident briefing: What happened, what data, next steps
   - Get permission for couple communication: Coordinator handles or we handle?

2. **Couple Notification (if required)**
   - Use pre-approved legal templates: Reviewed by legal counsel
   - Explain in non-technical terms: "Someone tried to access your wedding information"
   - Reassure about protections: "Your wedding day will not be affected"
   - Provide specific actions: Change passwords, monitor accounts

### Step 4: Technical Recovery (15-60 minutes)
1. **Eliminate Threat**
   - Block malicious IP addresses: Add to firewall blacklist
   - Patch security vulnerabilities: Deploy fixes immediately
   - Reset compromised credentials: Force password resets
   - Update security rules: Prevent similar attacks

2. **Restore Normal Operations**
   - Verify threat elimination: Run security scans
   - Gradually restore access: Monitor for continued attacks
   - Test all wedding functions: Ensure couples/vendors can access normally
   - Lift security lockdown: Only after complete verification
