# TEAM C - WS-262 Security Audit System Integration
## External Security Tool Integration & Real-Time Alerting

**FEATURE ID**: WS-262  
**TEAM**: C (Integration)  
**SPRINT**: Round 1  

### 🎯 WEDDING USER STORY

**As a wedding platform security operations manager**, I need seamless integration between our security audit system and external security tools (SIEM, threat intelligence, vulnerability scanners) so when suspicious activity involving couples' wedding data is detected, alerts immediately flow to our security team via multiple channels while maintaining complete audit trails for legal compliance.

**As a DevOps engineer responsible for wedding day security**, I need automated integration with security monitoring tools that can correlate threats across multiple systems and immediately notify our incident response team when security events could impact live weddings or couples' private information.

### 🏗️ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

Build comprehensive **Security Integration Layer** connecting our security audit system with external security tools, SIEM platforms, and multi-channel alerting systems.

**Core Integrations Needed:**
- SIEM integration (Splunk, ELK Stack, DataDog Security)
- Threat intelligence feeds (MISP, ThreatConnect, Recorded Future) 
- Vulnerability scanning integration (Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys)
- Multi-channel security alerting (PagerDuty, Slack, SMS, email)
- Security orchestration and automated response (SOAR)

### 🔗 SECURITY INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

**Real-Time Security Data Flow:**
```
Wedding Platform Security Event → Audit Logging → 
Multiple Destinations:
├── SIEM Platform (Splunk/ELK)
├── Threat Intelligence Analysis
├── Vulnerability Correlation
├── Security Orchestration (SOAR)
└── Multi-Channel Alerting
    ├── PagerDuty (P0/P1 incidents)
    ├── Slack (#security-alerts)
    ├── SMS (Critical threats)
    └── Email (Security team)
```

**Wedding-Aware Security Integration:**
```
Security Event Detection → Wedding Impact Assessment →
Threat Classification → Alert Routing → 
Response Orchestration → Compliance Reporting
```

### 🔧 INTEGRATION COMPONENTS TO BUILD

**SIEM Integration Service:**
```typescript
class SIEMIntegrationManager {
    // Splunk integration for comprehensive security monitoring
    async sendToSplunk(securityEvent: SecurityEvent) {
        const splunkEvent = {
            time: Date.now() / 1000,
            host: process.env.HOSTNAME,
            source: 'wedsync-security-audit',
            sourcetype: 'json',
            index: 'wedding-security',
            event: {
                ...securityEvent,

                compliance_flags: this.getComplianceFlags(securityEvent)
            }
        };
        
        await this.splunkClient.send(splunkEvent);
    }
    
    // ELK Stack integration for log aggregation and analysis
    async sendToElasticsearch(securityEvent: SecurityEvent) {

### 🚨 WEDDING-CRITICAL ALERT INTEGRATION

**Wedding Day Security Escalation:**
```typescript
const WEDDING_DAY_ALERT_PROTOCOLS = {
    SATURDAY_ESCALATION: {
        description: "Enhanced alerting during peak wedding days",
        triggers: ["Any security event on Saturdays", "Multiple failed logins", "Suspicious data access"],
        escalation_time: "2 minutes maximum",
        notification_channels: ["Phone calls", "SMS", "Slack @channel", "PagerDuty critical"]

            containment_status: 'IN_PROGRESS'
        });
    }
}
```

### ✅ COMPLETION CRITERIA

**Must Deliver:**
1. **SIEM integration** sending all security events to external monitoring platforms
2. **Threat intelligence enrichment** correlating security events with known threats
3. **Multi-channel alerting** routing alerts based on severity and wedding impact
4. **SOAR integration** for automated incident response and containment
5. **Compliance reporting** generating audit reports for regulatory requirements

**Evidence Required:**
```bash
# Prove security integrations exist:
ls -la /wedsync/src/lib/integrations/security/
cat /wedsync/src/lib/integrations/security/siem-integration.ts | head -20

# Prove they compile:
npm run typecheck
# Must show: "No errors found"

# Prove they work:
npm test integrations/security
# Must show: "All security integration tests passing"

# Test SIEM integration:
curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/security/test-siem-integration \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer admin-token"
# Should send test event to configured SIEM

# Test alert routing:
curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/security/test-alert-routing \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer admin-token" \
  -d '{"severity": "P1_HIGH", "wedding_impact": true}'
# Should trigger alerts via multiple channels
```

**Wedding Security Integration Test:**
- Security events stream to SIEM platforms within 30 seconds
- Threat intelligence enrichment completes within 10 seconds of event detection
- Critical alerts reach security team via multiple channels within 2 minutes
- Wedding-impacting incidents trigger enhanced escalation procedures
- SOAR playbooks execute automated containment within 5 minutes

### 🚨 WEDDING DAY CONSIDERATIONS

**Critical Integration Requirements:**
- **Real-time event streaming** - security events must reach external systems immediately
- **Wedding impact assessment** - all alerts include assessment of wedding day impact
- **Enhanced Saturday monitoring** - increased alerting sensitivity during peak wedding days
- **Legal compliance integration** - automated GDPR breach assessment and reporting
- **Emergency response automation** - SOAR playbooks for immediate threat containment

**Integration Performance Requirements:**
- Security event processing and forwarding within 5 seconds
- Threat intelligence enrichment within 10 seconds
- Multi-channel alert delivery within 30 seconds
- SOAR playbook execution initiation within 60 seconds
- Compliance report generation within 15 minutes

### 💼 BUSINESS IMPACT

These security integrations ensure:
- **Comprehensive threat detection** through external security tool correlation
- **Rapid incident response** via automated alerting and SOAR integration
- **Legal compliance automation** for GDPR, SOC2, and industry regulations
- **Wedding day protection** through enhanced monitoring and escalation procedures
- **Operational excellence** via centralized security monitoring and response

**Risk Mitigation:** Prevents security incidents from impacting couples' weddings by ensuring rapid detection, assessment, and response to threats through integrated security tooling.

**Compliance Excellence:** Maintains comprehensive audit trails and automated compliance reporting required for enterprise customers and regulatory audits in the wedding industry.
