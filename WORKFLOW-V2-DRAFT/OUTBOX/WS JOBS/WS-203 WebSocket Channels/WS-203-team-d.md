# WS-203-TEAM-D: WebSocket Channels Performance Infrastructure
## Generated: 2025-01-20 | Development Manager Session | Feature: WS-203 WebSocket Channels

---

## 🎯 MISSION: BULLETPROOF WEBSOCKET PERFORMANCE ARCHITECTURE

**Your mission as Team D (Performance/Infrastructure Specialists):** Build enterprise-grade WebSocket performance infrastructure that maintains sub-200ms channel switching, supports 500+ concurrent connections per supplier during wedding season peaks, and delivers 99.9% uptime with intelligent caching, connection pooling, and auto-scaling capabilities.

**Impact:** Enables photographers managing 15+ weddings simultaneously to switch between channels instantly, prevents system degradation during June wedding season traffic spikes (10x normal load), and ensures real-time coordination never fails when couples need urgent vendor communication.

## 📋 EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Before you can claim completion, you MUST provide concrete evidence:

### 🔍 MANDATORY FILE PROOF
```bash
# Run these exact commands and include output in your completion report:
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/performance/websocket/
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/cache/channel-cache/
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/monitoring/websocket-performance/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/performance/websocket/connection-pool.ts | head -20
```

### 🧪 MANDATORY TEST VALIDATION
```bash
# All these commands MUST pass:
cd $WS_ROOT/wedsync && npm run typecheck
cd $WS_ROOT/wedsync && npm test -- --testPathPattern=performance
cd $WS_ROOT/wedsync && npm test -- --testPathPattern=connection-pool
cd $WS_ROOT/wedsync && npm run test:load -- websocket-channels
```

### 🎭 MANDATORY E2E PROOF
Your delivery MUST include Playwright test evidence showing:
- 500+ concurrent WebSocket connections maintained
- Sub-200ms channel switching performance
- Auto-scaling activation during traffic spikes
- Connection pooling optimization working
- Cache hit ratio >95% during peak usage

**NO EXCEPTIONS:** Without this evidence, your work is incomplete regardless of performance optimization quality.

## 🧠 ENHANCED SERENA MCP ACTIVATION

### 🤖 SERENA INTELLIGENCE SETUP
```bash
# MANDATORY: Activate Serena's performance pattern analysis
mcp__serena__activate_project("wedsync")
mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/lib/performance")
mcp__serena__find_symbol("ConnectionPool")
mcp__serena__write_memory("websocket-performance", "WebSocket channel performance optimization for 500+ concurrent connections")
```

**Serena-Enhanced Performance Development:**
1. **Performance Pattern Analysis**: Analyze existing caching and connection patterns
2. **Bottleneck Identification**: Use Serena to identify performance bottlenecks in WebSocket flows
3. **Code Optimization**: Leverage semantic understanding for performance-critical code paths
4. **Memory Management**: Optimize connection lifecycle and memory usage patterns

## 🧩 SEQUENTIAL THINKING ACTIVATION - PERFORMANCE ARCHITECTURE

```typescript
mcp__sequential_thinking__sequentialthinking({
  thought: "I need to design a high-performance WebSocket channel system that can handle wedding season traffic spikes. Key performance challenges: 1) Connection management for 500+ concurrent connections per supplier 2) Sub-200ms channel switching performance 3) Memory-efficient message queuing 4) Cache optimization for channel state 5) Auto-scaling for 10x traffic increases. The wedding context is critical - photographers manage multiple weddings simultaneously, and any performance degradation directly impacts real-time wedding coordination.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 8
})

mcp__sequential_thinking__sequentialthinking({
  thought: "For the technical architecture, I need to implement: 1) Connection pooling with intelligent resource management 2) Multi-layer caching (Redis for channel state, local cache for frequent operations) 3) Load balancing across WebSocket server instances 4) Performance monitoring with real-time metrics 5) Auto-scaling triggers based on connection count and response time. The connection pool must handle supplier peak usage patterns - burst traffic during 6-8pm when couples update wedding details.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 8
})

mcp__sequential_thinking__sequentialthinking({
  thought: "For caching strategy optimization: Channel metadata should be cached with 15-minute TTL, active subscriptions cached for 5 minutes, and message routing cached for 1 minute. Redis cluster configuration needs read replicas for cache hit optimization. Connection state must be persisted to handle server restarts gracefully. Performance metrics need real-time dashboard showing connection count, response times, cache hit ratios, and memory usage trends.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 8
})

// Continue structured analysis through monitoring, alerting, scaling patterns...

import { z } from 'zod';
import { rateLimitService } from '$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/rate-limiter';
import { performanceMonitor } from '$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/monitoring/performance';

const connectionPoolConfigSchema = z.object({
  maxConnections: z.number().min(1).max(2000),
  connectionTimeout: z.number().min(5000).max(60000),
  heartbeatInterval: z.number().min(10000).max(120000)
});

class SecureConnectionPool {
  async createConnection(userId: string, channelName: string) {
    // Rate limit: 10 connections/minute per user
    await rateLimitService.checkLimit(`conn:${userId}`, 10, 60);
    
    // Performance monitoring for security anomalies
    performanceMonitor.trackConnectionAttempt(userId, channelName);
    
    // Security audit: Connection attempts
    // Resource limits: Per-user connection quotas
    // DoS protection: Connection rate limiting
  }
}
```

## 💒 WEDDING INDUSTRY CONTEXT

### 🤝 REAL WEDDING SCENARIOS FOR TEAM D

**Scenario 1: Wedding Season Traffic Surge**
- June wedding season: 10x normal traffic increase
- 50+ suppliers managing multiple weddings simultaneously
- Peak usage: 6-8pm when couples update details
- System must maintain sub-200ms performance
- Auto-scaling prevents system degradation

**Scenario 2: Multi-Wedding Photographer Peak Usage**
- Photographer managing 15 weddings in one month
- Rapidly switching between wedding channels
- Each channel switch must be < 200ms
- Connection pooling optimizes resource usage
- Cache warming prevents cold-start delays

**Scenario 3: Venue Coordinator Broadcast Load**
- Large venue hosting 5 weddings same weekend
- Coordinator needs instant communication with all couples
- Broadcast messages to 100+ channel subscribers
- Message delivery must maintain < 500ms latency
- Performance monitoring ensures system reliability

### 🔗 WEDDING WORKFLOW PERFORMANCE PATTERNS

**Traffic Pattern Analysis:**
```typescript
