## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Complex Analysis
```typescript
// Use for complex architectural decisions
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This Google Places integration requires careful analysis of: 1) Autocomplete component architecture with real-time search debouncing, 2) Venue details display with photos and ratings, 3) Location picker for wedding venue selection, 4) Integration with existing wedding planning workflows. I need to consider API rate limiting, caching strategies, and mobile responsiveness for wedding planners on-site.",

## üìã TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION: WS-219 Google Places Integration

### WEDDING CONTEXT & USER STORY
**As a wedding planner helping couples find venues and vendors, I want to search for and auto-populate venue details, addresses, and contact information from Google Places, so that I can quickly add verified venue information without manual data entry, ensure accurate addresses for vendor coordination, and provide couples with rich venue details including photos, reviews, and contact info, saving 15-20 minutes per venue research.**

**Real Wedding Scenario:** A couple wants their ceremony at "Castello di Casole" in Tuscany but only knows the name. The wedding planner uses Google Places integration to search and instantly pulls in the complete address, phone number, website, photos, and exact GPS coordinates. When creating vendor lists, they search "florists near Napa Valley" and get verified flower shops with ratings and contact details.

### CORE FRONTEND COMPONENTS TO BUILD:

1. **GooglePlacesAutocomplete Component**
   - Real-time autocomplete with debouncing (300ms)
   - Wedding venue type filtering (venues, restaurants, churches, parks)
   - Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, enter, escape)
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Mobile-responsive design for on-site planning

2. **PlaceDetails Component**
   - Venue information display (name, address, phone, website)
   - Photo gallery with Google Places photos
   - Reviews and ratings display
   - Operating hours and accessibility information
   - "Add to Wedding" action button

3. **LocationPicker Component**
   - Interactive map integration for venue selection
   - Multiple venue pins for ceremony/reception comparison
   - Distance calculations between venues
   - Mobile-friendly touch interactions

4. **NearbyPlacesSearch Component**
   - Location-based vendor discovery
   - Category filtering (florists, photographers, caterers)
   - Results grid with distance sorting
   - Quick actions for contacting vendors

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- TypeScript interfaces for all Google Places data
