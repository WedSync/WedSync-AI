ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/services/venue-coordination-service.ts
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/integrations/location-services-hub.ts
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/integrations/places-wedding-sync.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test integration/places
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

## üìö STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION
```typescript
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("wedding.*coordination");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("VenueCoordinationService", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/lib/services");
```

### B. REF MCP INTEGRATION PATTERNS
```typescript
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("third party API data synchronization patterns");
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation("webhook integration location services");
```
