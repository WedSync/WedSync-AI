# TEAM D - ROUND 1: WS-238 - Knowledge Base System
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Create mobile-optimized PWA knowledge base experience for WedMe platform with offline access, voice search, and couple-specific wedding guidance
**FEATURE ID:** WS-238 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about mobile-first wedding guidance, offline article access, and couple-friendly help systems during wedding planning

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/app/(wedme)/knowledge-base/
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/wedme/knowledge-base/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/wedme/knowledge-base/MobileKnowledgeBase.tsx | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test wedme/knowledge-base
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## üìö STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query existing WedMe mobile patterns and PWA components
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("wedme.*component|mobile.*optimization|pwa.*feature");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("MobileLayout", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/app/(wedme)/");
```

### B. MOBILE PWA & WEDME PATTERNS (MANDATORY FOR PLATFORM WORK)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Load mobile PWA and WedMe platform patterns
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/wedme/layout/MobileLayout.tsx");
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/public/manifest.json");
```

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation for PWA patterns, offline functionality, and mobile optimization
# Use Ref MCP to search for PWA implementation, service workers, and mobile UX patterns
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Complex Analysis
```typescript
// Use for mobile PWA and couple experience architecture
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "WedMe knowledge base needs: 1) Mobile-first interface for couples on-the-go, 2) Offline article access during venue visits, 3) Voice search for hands-free use, 4) Wedding timeline-specific help, 5) Couple-friendly language vs supplier terminology. The challenge is creating an intuitive experience for stressed couples planning their wedding while ensuring essential content is available offline.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5
});
```
