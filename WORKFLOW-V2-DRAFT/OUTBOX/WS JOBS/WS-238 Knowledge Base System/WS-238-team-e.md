# TEAM E - ROUND 1: WS-238 - Knowledge Base System
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Comprehensive quality assurance, testing, and documentation for wedding industry knowledge base system with focus on search accuracy, mobile performance, and couple experience validation
**FEATURE ID:** WS-238 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about testing search relevance for wedding suppliers, validating offline functionality, and documenting couple-friendly help systems

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/knowledge-base/
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/playwright-tests/knowledge-base/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/tests/knowledge-base/search-functionality.test.ts | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test knowledge-base
npm run test:e2e knowledge-base
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## 📚 STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query existing test patterns and documentation structures
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("test.*file|spec.*file|documentation");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("describe", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("tests/");
```

### B. TESTING FRAMEWORKS & DOCUMENTATION PATTERNS (MANDATORY FOR QA WORK)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Load existing testing and documentation patterns
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/playwright.config.ts");
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/jest.config.js");
```

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation for testing best practices, Playwright patterns, and QA methodologies
# Use Ref MCP to search for testing frameworks, QA patterns, and documentation standards
```

## 🧠 STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Complex Analysis
```typescript
// Use for comprehensive QA strategy development
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Testing knowledge base system requires: 1) Search accuracy validation with wedding terminology, 2) Mobile/offline functionality testing, 3) AI integration testing with mocked services, 4) Performance testing for search response times, 5) Accessibility testing for screen readers, 6) Cross-browser compatibility testing. The challenge is creating realistic test scenarios that match actual wedding supplier and couple workflows.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 7
});
```

- [ ] **Audit Trail Testing** - Verify proper logging and audit functionality

## 🧭 COMPREHENSIVE TESTING STRATEGY (MANDATORY)

### Testing Framework Architecture:

**1. Unit Testing (>90% Coverage Required):**
```typescript
// Knowledge base component testing
describe('KnowledgeBaseInterface', () => {
  test('should render search interface correctly');
  test('should handle search queries with wedding terminology');
  test('should display results with proper categorization');
  test('should handle empty search results gracefully');
  test('should validate search input and prevent injection');
});

// API endpoint testing
describe('Knowledge Base API', () => {
  test('POST /api/knowledge-base/search returns relevant results');
  test('GET /api/knowledge-base/articles/[slug] returns article content');
  test('POST /api/knowledge-base/feedback processes ratings correctly');
  test('API endpoints handle rate limiting appropriately');
});
```

**2. Integration Testing:**
```typescript
// AI service integration testing
describe('AI Search Integration', () => {
  test('should generate embeddings for article content');
  test('should perform semantic search with mocked OpenAI responses');
  test('should handle AI service failures gracefully');
  test('should cache embeddings for performance');
});

// Database integration testing
describe('Knowledge Base Database', () => {
  test('should store and retrieve articles correctly');
  test('should handle search analytics and feedback');
  test('should maintain data integrity during concurrent access');
});
```

## 🌟 WEDDING INDUSTRY TESTING SUCCESS SCENARIOS

**Test Scenario 1**: Wedding photographer searches "client questionnaire automation" - Validate that search returns relevant photography-specific articles within 300ms, displays properly on mobile, and tracks analytics correctly.

**Test Scenario 2**: Couple using WedMe app offline at venue - Validate cached articles load correctly, voice search works without internet, feedback is queued for sync, and all interactions are accessible.

**Test Scenario 3**: High-load testing with 100 concurrent supplier searches - Validate response times remain <500ms, database handles concurrent access, AI service rate limiting works, and user experience remains smooth.

**Performance Validation**: Knowledge base search must handle 1000+ concurrent users with <500ms response time, 99.9% uptime, and proper error handling for all edge cases.
