# TEAM A - ROUND 1: WS-238 - Knowledge Base System
## 2025-01-20 - Development Round 1

**YOUR MISSION:** Create comprehensive frontend interface for self-service knowledge base system that reduces wedding supplier support tickets by 40% through intelligent search and contextual help
**FEATURE ID:** WS-238 (Track all work with this ID)
**TIME LIMIT:** 2-3 hours per round  
**THINK ULTRA HARD** about wedding supplier workflow integration and context-aware help patterns

## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Before claiming completion, you MUST provide:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE PROOF:**
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/knowledge-base/
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/app/(dashboard)/knowledge-base/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/knowledge-base/KnowledgeBaseInterface.tsx | head -20
```

2. **TYPECHECK RESULTS:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **TEST RESULTS:**
```bash
npm test knowledge-base
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

**Teams submitting hallucinated implementations will be rejected immediately.**

## üìö STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION & CODEBASE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - 10 MINUTES!)

### A. SERENA PROJECT ACTIVATION (MINUTES 1-3)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Activate Serena for semantic code understanding
await mcp__serena__activate_project("$WS_ROOT/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// Query specific areas relevant to knowledge base feature
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("search.*component|help.*widget|article.*display");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("SearchInput", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/components/ui/search/");
```

### B. UI STYLE GUIDES & TECHNOLOGY STACK (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK)
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Load the correct UI Style Guide for general SaaS features

### C. REF MCP CURRENT DOCS (MINUTES 3-5)
```typescript
// Load documentation for knowledge base UI patterns and search interfaces
# Use Ref MCP to search for relevant documentation about search interfaces and help systems
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### Use Sequential Thinking MCP for Complex Analysis
```typescript
// Use for complex knowledge base interface architecture decisions
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This knowledge base system needs to serve wedding suppliers with varying tech expertise. I need to consider: intelligent search with autocomplete, categorized articles, contextual help widget, article rating system, and mobile-optimized interface. The challenge is making it intuitive for photographers, florists, and venue coordinators who may not be tech-savvy.",
