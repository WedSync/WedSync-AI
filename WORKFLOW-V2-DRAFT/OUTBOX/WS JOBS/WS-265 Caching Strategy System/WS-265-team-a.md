# TEAM A - WS-265 Caching Strategy System UI Dashboard
## Wedding Cache Performance Monitoring & Management Interface

**FEATURE ID**: WS-265  
**TEAM**: A (Frontend/UI)  
**SPRINT**: Round 1  

### üéØ WEDDING USER STORY

**As a wedding platform performance engineer monitoring cache systems during peak season**, I need a real-time caching dashboard that shows me cache hit rates, wedding data freshness, and cache warming status across all our systems, so I can ensure couples and vendors always get lightning-fast responses when accessing critical wedding information during time-sensitive coordination moments.

**As a wedding operations manager**, I need visual indicators showing which wedding data is cached, when cache expires, and cache performance impact on user experience, so I can proactively warm caches before big events and ensure no wedding coordination is slowed by cache misses.

### üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

Build a comprehensive **Caching Performance Dashboard** with real-time cache monitoring, wedding-aware cache management, and intelligent cache warming controls.

**Core Components:**
- Real-time cache hit/miss rate monitoring across all cache layers
- Wedding data cache freshness tracking with expiration warnings
- Cache warming controls for upcoming weddings and peak traffic
- Performance impact visualization showing cache effectiveness
- Emergency cache management for wedding day incidents

### üé® UI REQUIREMENTS

**Dashboard Layout:**
- **Cache Health Header**: Overall cache performance with wedding day status
- **Cache Layer Overview**: Redis, CDN, browser cache performance metrics
- **Wedding Cache Panel**: Active wedding data cache status and warming
- **Performance Charts**: Cache hit rates and response time improvements
- **Management Controls**: Cache warming, invalidation, and emergency controls

**Wedding-Specific Elements:**
- **Wedding Cache Freshness**: Visual indicators showing cached wedding data age
- **Saturday Cache Boost**: Display enhanced caching during wedding days
- **Vendor Cache Status**: Track cached vendor data and API responses
- **Guest Data Cache**: Monitor cached RSVP and guest information

### üìä CACHE PERFORMANCE VISUALIZATION

**Cache Metrics Display:**
```typescript
const WeddingCacheMetrics = {
    cache_hit_rates: {
        wedding_data: "95%+ hit rate for wedding information",
        vendor_apis: "90%+ hit rate for vendor integration responses",
        guest_interactions: "98%+ hit rate for RSVP and guest data",
        photo_thumbnails: "99%+ hit rate for wedding photo previews"
    },
    
    wedding_day_performance: {
        saturday_boost: "2x cache TTL for wedding day stability",
        active_wedding_priority: "Hot cache for active wedding data",
        vendor_response_caching: "Cache vendor API responses for 5 minutes",
        guest_portal_cache: "Aggressive caching for guest-facing pages"
    },
    
    cache_warming_status: {
        upcoming_weddings: "Pre-warm cache 2 hours before wedding",
        vendor_integration_data: "Warm cache for active vendor APIs",
        guest_list_data: "Cache guest lists during RSVP periods",
        photo_galleries: "Pre-generate and cache photo thumbnails"
    }
};
```
