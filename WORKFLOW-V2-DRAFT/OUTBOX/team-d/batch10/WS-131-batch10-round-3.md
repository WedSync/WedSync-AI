# TEAM D - ROUND 3: WS-131 - Pricing Strategy System - Final Integration & Production

**Date:** 2025-01-24  
**Feature ID:** WS-131 (Track all work with this ID)  
**Priority:** P0 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Complete subscription system integration with production optimization and comprehensive testing  
**Context:** You are Team D working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before deployment.

---

## 🎯 USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding planner managing WedSync's business operations
**I want to:** Implement a tiered subscription system that converts free users to paid plans through value-driven upgrades
**So that:** We achieve sustainable revenue growth while providing clear value at each price point

**Real Business Scenario:**
A photography business starts with our free plan to test the platform with 3 couples. After seeing 40% faster client onboarding and 6 hours saved per wedding, they upgrade to Professional ($49/month) for unlimited clients. When they reach 20+ weddings per year and need advanced automation features, they upgrade to Premium ($149/month), increasing their annual revenue by $15,000 while reducing administrative overhead by 60%.

## 📚 STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. LOAD CORRECT UI STYLE GUIDE (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK):
// For ALL OTHER UI features (General SaaS components):
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. CONTEXT7 MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
await mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("stripe");  // Get correct library ID first
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/stripe/stripe-node", "production-webhooks monitoring", 5000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/vercel/next.js", "production-optimization caching", 3000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/supabase/supabase", "production-deployment edge-functions", 2000);

// For this specific feature, also load:
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/recharts/recharts", "revenue-analytics production", 2000);

// 2. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// 3. REVIEW integration patterns from Round 2:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("RevenueAnalyticsService", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("/src/lib/billing/");

// NOW you have current docs + billing context. Agents can work intelligently!
```

**WHY THIS ORDER MATTERS:**
- Context7 ensures production-ready Stripe implementation patterns
- Serena shows Round 2 billing foundations to build upon
- Agents work with complete revenue analytics knowledge

---

## 🚀 STEP 2: LAUNCH PARALLEL AGENTS (AFTER documentation loaded!)

**NOW that you have current docs, launch agents with specific knowledge:**

1. **task-tracker-coordinator** --think-hard --with-context7-docs "Final subscription system integration and deployment"
2. **nextjs-fullstack-developer** --think-hard --use-loaded-docs "Production billing optimization and monitoring"
3. **data-analytics-engineer** --think-ultra-hard --follow-existing-patterns "Revenue analytics and business intelligence production setup" 
4. **security-compliance-officer** --think-ultra-hard --check-current-best-practices
5. **test-automation-architect** --e2e-focus --use-testing-patterns-from-docs
6. **playwright-visual-testing-specialist** --accessibility-first --production-validation
7. **code-quality-guardian** --production-ready --match-codebase-style

**AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** "Use the Context7 docs loaded in Step 1. Focus on production readiness and team integration."

**AGENT USAGE TARGET:** >75% of session time in parallel execution

---

## 📋 STEP 3: DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (With loaded docs + agents)

### **EXPLORE PHASE (NO CODING!)**
- Read ALL team integration outputs from Round 2
- Understand complete subscription system architecture
- Check all cross-team dependencies and usage tracking
- Review production deployment requirements for billing systems
- Continue until system integration is FULLY understood

### **PLAN PHASE (THINK HARD!)**
- Create comprehensive integration plan for final round
- Write production test cases FIRST (TDD)
- Plan monitoring and alerting strategies for revenue systems
- Consider production scalability requirements for billing
- Don't rush - final billing integration requires precision

### **CODE PHASE (PARALLEL AGENTS!)**
- Write comprehensive tests before implementation
- Follow production-ready patterns for financial systems
- Use Context7 examples for advanced Stripe optimization
- Implement with parallel agents focusing on reliability
- Focus on security and compliance, not just functionality

### **COMMIT PHASE (VERIFY EVERYTHING!)**
- Run all tests including complex subscription scenarios
- Verify with comprehensive Playwright billing testing
- Create complete evidence package for billing flows
- Generate production readiness reports for revenue systems
- Only mark complete when PRODUCTION READY
