## ðŸŽ¯ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding photographer working on-site with intermittent connectivity  
**I want to:** Access AI-powered template recommendations and advanced mobile features offline  
**So that:** I can create perfect client dashboards even in remote venues with poor internet coverage  

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**  
Mountain venues, beach locations, and historic estates often have poor cellular coverage. Photographers need to access intelligent template suggestions, create complex templates with advanced gestures, and sync changes when connectivity returns. The mobile system must cache AI recommendations, provide offline template creation with advanced features, and seamlessly sync when back online.
