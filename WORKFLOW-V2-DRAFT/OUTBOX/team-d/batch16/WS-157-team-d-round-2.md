## ðŸŽ¯ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding couple delegating tasks to family and friends
**I want to:** Assign specific wedding tasks to helpers with clear instructions and timing
**So that:** Everyone knows their responsibilities and can execute tasks without confusion on the wedding day

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
A couple currently creates handwritten task lists like "Mom - handle gifts table" without clear timing or instructions. With this feature, they assign "Mary Johnson - Gift table setup (5:00pm-5:30pm) - Set up gift table in foyer, arrange card box, ensure gift security" with automatic notifications and check-in reminders.
