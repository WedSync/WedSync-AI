## 📚 STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. LOAD CORRECT UI STYLE GUIDE (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK):
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. CONTEXT7 MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
await mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("next.js");  
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/vercel/next.js", "production pwa app-store", 5000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/supabase/supabase", "production-mobile offline-sync", 3000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss", "mobile-polish production", 2000);

// 2. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);

// 3. REVIEW all WedMe implementations from rounds 1-2:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("PhotoGroupsMobile", "", true);
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("MobileGroupBuilder", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/components/wedme");
```
