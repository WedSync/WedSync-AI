## 🧭 NAVIGATION INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

**Critical Navigation Context:**
This feature must integrate seamlessly with WedSync's navigation system to provide intuitive user flows and maintain consistent user experience across all wedding management workflows.

### Navigation Implementation Requirements

**1. Breadcrumb Integration**
```tsx
// Add breadcrumb support to all new pages/components
import { Breadcrumb } from '@/components/ui/breadcrumb'

// Example breadcrumb hierarchy for this feature:
// Dashboard > Helpers > Schedules > [Helper Name] > [Schedule Details]
const breadcrumbItems = [
  { label: 'Dashboard', href: '/dashboard' },
  { label: 'Helpers', href: '/helpers' },
  { label: 'Schedules', href: '/helpers/schedules' },
  { label: helperName, href: `/helpers/schedules/${helperId}` },
  { label: 'Details', href: undefined } // current page
]
```

**2. Menu Integration Points**
- **Main Navigation**: Add/update relevant menu items in main navigation
- **Contextual Menus**: Implement context-sensitive navigation options
- **Quick Actions**: Provide navigation shortcuts for common workflows

**3. Mobile Navigation Considerations**
```tsx
// Ensure mobile-first responsive navigation
// Use progressive disclosure for complex navigation trees
// Implement touch-friendly navigation controls
// Consider swipe gestures for timeline/schedule navigation
```

**4. Navigation State Management**
```tsx
// Implement navigation state persistence
// Handle deep linking and shareable URLs
// Maintain navigation context across page refreshes
// Support browser back/forward functionality
```

**5. User Flow Integration**
- **Entry Points**: Define how users access this feature from existing workflows
- **Exit Points**: Provide clear paths to related features and main dashboard
- **Cross-Feature Navigation**: Enable seamless transitions between related features

**6. Wedding Context Navigation**
```tsx
// Maintain wedding context in navigation
// Support multi-wedding navigation switching
// Preserve user's current wedding selection across feature navigation
// Implement wedding-specific navigation shortcuts
```

**Navigation Testing Requirements:**
- Test all breadcrumb paths and hierarchy
- Verify mobile navigation responsiveness
- Validate deep linking functionality
- Test navigation state persistence
- Ensure keyboard navigation accessibility
- Verify screen reader navigation support
