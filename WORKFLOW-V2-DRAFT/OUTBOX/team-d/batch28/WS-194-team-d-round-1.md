## üéØ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** WedSync DevOps administrator managing environment configurations during deployment workflows
**I want to:** Intuitive configuration interfaces for environment switching, secret rotation management, and feature flag controls with validation feedback  
**So that:** I can safely manage environment configurations during peak wedding season deployments, quickly switch between development/staging/production environments, schedule secret rotations without service disruption, and control feature flag rollouts to ensure couples maintain access to vendor coordination during critical wedding planning phases

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
During a critical deployment window in peak wedding season, DevOps needs to rotate API keys for payment processing while maintaining service for 200+ couples completing vendor payments. The configuration UI provides clear environment switching between staging validation and production deployment, visual confirmation of secret rotation schedules, and feature flag controls to gradually enable new payment features without disrupting active wedding coordination workflows, ensuring couples can continue making venue deposits and vendor payments without interruption.

## üß† SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP FOR COMPLEX FEATURE ANALYSIS

### When to Use Sequential Thinking

Before diving into coding, use Sequential Thinking MCP when facing:

- **Complex Feature Architecture**: Multi-component systems with intricate dependencies
- **Integration Challenges**: Features that span multiple systems and require coordination  
- **Business Logic Complexity**: Wedding-specific rules that need careful analysis
- **Technical Trade-offs**: Choosing between multiple implementation approaches
- **Debugging Complex Issues**: Root cause analysis for multi-system problems

### Sequential Thinking Patterns for Development Teams

#### Pattern 1: Feature Architecture Analysis
```typescript
// Before starting complex feature development
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This task tracking feature needs to integrate with existing task creation (WS-156), helper assignment (WS-157), and real-time notifications. Need to analyze data flow and identify potential integration points.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Data flow analysis: User creates task -> assigns helpers -> helpers update status -> triggers notifications -> updates progress indicators. Each step requires API endpoints, validation, and error handling.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

#### Pattern 2: Integration Strategy Planning  
```typescript
// When coordinating with other teams' work
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Team A is building UI components, Team C is handling real-time updates, and Team E is implementing testing. Need to define clear API contracts and data structures that all teams can use.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 3
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "API contract definition: /api/tasks/status endpoints need to support CRUD operations, validation schemas, and webhook events. Response format should match Team A's UI expectations.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 3
});
```

#### Pattern 3: Business Logic Analysis
```typescript
// When implementing wedding-specific business rules
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding task tracking has unique requirements: tasks can be delegated to multiple helpers, status updates need photo evidence for critical tasks, and deadlines are tied to wedding date proximity.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Business rule implementation: Critical tasks (venue confirmation, catering numbers) require photo evidence. Non-critical tasks (decoration pickup) can be marked complete without evidence. Need validation logic for each task type.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

### Using Sequential Thinking in Your Development Process

1. **Before Documentation Loading**: Use Sequential Thinking to understand the full scope and complexity
2. **During Planning Phase**: Structure your approach to handle all edge cases and integration points  
3. **When Stuck**: Use Sequential Thinking to work through complex problems systematically
4. **For Reviews**: Use Sequential Thinking to verify your implementation covers all requirements

**Remember**: Complex features require systematic thinking. Use Sequential Thinking MCP to ensure thorough analysis before implementation.

## üìö STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. LOAD CORRECT UI STYLE GUIDE (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK):
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. Ref MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "Next.js 15 App Router Server Components forms latest"});
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "Supabase realtime database auth latest documentation"});
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "Tailwind CSS v4 components styling patterns"});
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "React 19 hooks patterns best practices"});

// 3. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// 4. REVIEW existing admin interface patterns and configuration components:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("AdminConfig", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/components/admin");
```

---

## üîí SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### MANDATORY SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION FOR CONFIGURATION UI

**EVERY configuration component MUST use the security framework at `/src/lib/validation/` and `/src/lib/security/`:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS (MANDATORY PATTERN FOR CONFIGURATION UI):
import { withSecureAdminAccess } from '@/lib/validation/middleware';
import { environmentConfigSchema } from '@/lib/validation/schemas';

// Configuration UI with proper admin security validation
export const ConfigurationForm = withSecureAdminAccess(
  ['admin', 'devops'], // Required roles for configuration management
  async (user: AdminUser) => {
    // User is validated admin with configuration access
    // Configuration UI implementation here
  }
);
```

### SECURITY CHECKLIST FOR CONFIGURATION UI

Teams MUST implement ALL of these for EVERY configuration component:

- [ ] **Admin Authentication**: Use existing middleware with admin/DevOps role validation for configuration access
- [ ] **Configuration Access Control**: MANDATORY role-based access for environment configuration and secret management
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Configuration API calls must respect admin tier rate limits - DO NOT bypass
- [ ] **CSRF Protection**: All configuration forms use CSRF tokens - automatic via middleware
- [ ] **Input Sanitization**: All configuration data uses proper validation - see `/src/lib/security/input-validation.ts`
- [ ] **Secret Protection**: NEVER display actual secret values in UI - show masked/hashed versions only
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: All configuration changes logged with admin user identification - use existing audit framework
- [ ] **Session Security**: Admin configuration sessions have enhanced security and timeout validation
- [ ] **Error Handling**: NEVER expose internal configuration details or system architecture in error messages

---

## üé≠ REVOLUTIONARY PLAYWRIGHT MCP TESTING (MANDATORY)
