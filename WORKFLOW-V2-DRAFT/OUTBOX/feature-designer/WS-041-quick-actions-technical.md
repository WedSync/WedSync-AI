# TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION: WS-041 - Quick Actions
## Generated by Feature Development Session - 2025-08-21

### USER STORY & BUSINESS CONTEXT (THINK HARD - BE FACTUAL)
**As a:** Busy wedding professional who repeats the same actions daily
**I want to:** Access common tasks like "Add New Client", "Send Timeline Form", "Create Gallery" with one click
**So that:** I can complete routine tasks in seconds instead of navigating through multiple screens

**Real Wedding Scenario:**
A photographer's most common actions are: "Add New Client" (used 3x/week), "Send Timeline Form" (2x/week), "Upload Gallery" (1x/week), "Send Invoice" (4x/week). Quick actions bar puts these one click away from any page.
