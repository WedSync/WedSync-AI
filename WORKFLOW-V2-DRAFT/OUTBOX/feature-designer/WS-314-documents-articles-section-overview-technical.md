# TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION: WS-314 - Documents Articles Section Overview
## Generated by Feature Development Session - 2025-01-20

### USER STORY & BUSINESS CONTEXT (THINK HARD - BE FACTUAL)
**As a:** Wedding planner who provides couples with planning guides, contracts, and educational articles
**I want to:** Organize and share wedding planning documents, articles, and resources through a centralized system
**So that:** I can eliminate sending the same wedding planning PDFs via email repeatedly and provide couples with searchable, organized access to all wedding information

**Real Wedding Scenario:**
"A wedding planner maintains a library of 50+ planning documents (timeline templates, vendor guides, contract templates, planning checklists) that they email to couples based on their needs. Currently couples lose these files or can't find them later. With documents/articles system, all planning resources are organized in categories, searchable, and automatically shared based on wedding package type."
