# TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION: WS-312 - Client Dashboard Builder Section Overview
## Generated by Feature Development Session - 2025-01-20

### USER STORY & BUSINESS CONTEXT (THINK HARD - BE FACTUAL)
**As a:** Wedding photographer who wants to provide each couple with a personalized client portal
**I want to:** Build custom dashboard layouts for couples showing their wedding timeline, photo galleries, forms, and vendor connections
**So that:** I can eliminate sending wedding information through scattered emails and give couples a professional branded experience that reduces my customer support by 60%

**Real Wedding Scenario:**
"A wedding photographer currently sends couples information via email: timeline updates in one email, photo previews in another, vendor contact info in a third. Couples lose track of important details. With a client dashboard builder, the photographer creates a branded portal where couples see their timeline, photos, vendor info, and forms all in one place, with updates automatically syncing."
