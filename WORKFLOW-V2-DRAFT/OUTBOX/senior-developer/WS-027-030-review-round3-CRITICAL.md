**Performance:**
- API response: **UNKNOWN - BUILD FAILS**
- Database queries: **O(n²) ALGORITHMS DETECTED**

**Review verdict:** ❌ REJECTED

**Platform Quality:**
- [ ] Couple features working - **CORE FILES MISSING**
- [ ] Mobile optimized - **CANNOT VERIFY**
- [ ] Consistent with supplier side - **INCOMPLETE**
- [ ] Data syncing correctly - **FILES DON'T EXIST**

**Missing Implementation:**
- template-performance.ts - **DOES NOT EXIST**
- ab-testing-engine.ts - **DOES NOT EXIST**
- TemplateAnalyticsDashboard.tsx - **DOES NOT EXIST**
- /api/analytics/templates/ directory - **DOES NOT EXIST**

**Files that exist:**
- ✅ /wedsync/src/components/analytics/ab-tests/ABTestDashboard.tsx (enhanced existing)

### TEAM E - DEVELOPMENT (WS-030)
**What they built:** No completion report found in INBOX
**Review verdict:** ❌ REJECTED (NO SUBMISSION)

---

### CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE FIX

1. **[SECURITY]** Team C: Complete authentication bypass in A/B testing service
2. **[SECURITY]** Team C: SQL injection vulnerabilities in statistics engine
3. **[SECURITY]** Team C: XSS vulnerabilities in UI components
4. **[CRITICAL]** Team B: 100% hallucinated implementation - no actual code
5. **[BLOCKING]** System Build: Complete compilation failure
6. **[BLOCKING]** TypeScript: 200+ compilation errors
7. **[BLOCKING]** ESLint: 500+ linting errors including excessive 'any' usage

### PATTERNS TO ENFORCE
- **MANDATORY:** All file claims must be verified before review
- **MANDATORY:** Authentication required on ALL service methods
- **MANDATORY:** Input validation on ALL user inputs
- **MANDATORY:** No 'any' types in production code
- **ZERO TOLERANCE:** For hallucinated features

### BLOCKED MERGES
These CANNOT merge until fixed:
- **Team B:** Complete rebuild required - current submission is fictional
- **Team C:** Critical security vulnerabilities must be resolved
- **Team D:** Missing core implementation files
- **Team E:** No submission provided

### APPROVED FOR MERGE
**NONE** - All teams blocked due to critical issues

### GITHUB COMMIT READY
**NO COMMITS APPROVED** - All submissions rejected

### ACTION ITEMS FOR NEXT ROUND
- **Team B:** Start over - implement actual message history system
- **Team C:** Fix authentication, SQL injection, XSS, and input validation
- **Team D:** Implement missing analytics files
- **Team E:** Submit completion report and implementation
- **ALL TEAMS:** Fix TypeScript compilation errors
- **ALL TEAMS:** Resolve ESLint violations

### OVERALL QUALITY SCORE
- Code Quality: 2/10 (Massive failures)
- Security: 1/10 (Critical vulnerabilities)
- Performance: 0/10 (Cannot measure - build fails)
- Testing: 0/10 (No functional code to test)
- Documentation: 3/10 (Over-documented non-existent features)

**Round verdict:** ❌ STOP AND FIX

### SYSTEM VERIFICATION RESULTS

**TypeScript Compilation:** ❌ FAILED
- 200+ compilation errors
- Type safety completely compromised
- Parameter interface mismatches

**ESLint:** ❌ FAILED  
- 500+ linting errors
- Excessive 'any' type usage
- Unused variables and imports

**Build Process:** ❌ FAILED
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/ui/slider'
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/security/booking-security'
Syntax Error in journey-engine/executor.ts
```

**Security Scan:** ❌ CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES
- Authentication bypass
- SQL injection
- XSS vulnerabilities
- PII exposure

### LEARNINGS TO CAPTURE

**File:** `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SESSION-LOGS/LEARNINGS/2025-01-21-hallucination-prevention.md`

**Critical Pattern Identified: Hallucinated Feature Epidemic**
- **What went wrong:** Teams claiming to implement files that don't exist
- **How to prevent:** Mandatory file verification before review acceptance
- **Code examples:** 100% fictional implementations accepted as real
- **Checklist for teams:** 
  1. Verify every claimed file exists
  2. Check line counts meet minimum standards
  3. Validate actual code vs. documentation
  4. Run compilation tests before submission

**File:** `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SESSION-LOGS/LEARNINGS/2025-01-21-security-critical.md`

**Security Pattern: Complete Authentication Bypass**
- **What went wrong:** No security checks in service layer
- **How to prevent:** Mandatory security review before any integration
- **Code examples:** Direct database access without auth validation
- **Checklist for teams:**
  1. Authentication on ALL endpoints
  2. Input validation on ALL inputs
  3. SQL parameterization mandatory
  4. XSS prevention in all UI

**Remember: This is a STOP situation. No code should be merged until all critical issues are resolved. The level of fundamental failures requires a complete review of development processes.**
