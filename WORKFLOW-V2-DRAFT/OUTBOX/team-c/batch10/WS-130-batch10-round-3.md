# TEAM C - ROUND 3: WS-130 - Photography Library AI - Final Integration & Polish

**Date:** 2025-01-24  
**Feature ID:** WS-130 (Track all work with this ID)  
**Priority:** HIGH from roadmap  
**Mission:** Complete AI photography system integration and production optimization  
**Context:** You are Team C working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before deployment.

## 🎯 USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding florist designing 120+ arrangements per year with varying seasonal availability and sustainability concerns
**I want to:** Access AI-powered flower selection that considers seasonality, color harmony, sustainability, and allergen compatibility
**So that:** I reduce 3 hours per consultation spent on flower research and eliminate client disappointment from unavailable or problematic flower choices

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
A couple wants "dusty rose and eucalyptus" for their November outdoor wedding in Chicago. Instead of manually checking seasonal charts and allergen lists, the florist enters the color scheme and date. The AI suggests alternatives like "mauve chrysanthemums with silver brunia" (in season, allergy-friendly), calculates sustainability scores based on local growing regions, and generates care timelines to ensure peak freshness on wedding day.

## 📚 STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. LOAD CORRECT UI STYLE GUIDE (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK):
// For ALL OTHER UI features (General SaaS components):
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. CONTEXT7 MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
await mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("next.js");  // Get correct library ID first
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/vercel/next.js", "production-optimization caching", 5000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/supabase/supabase", "edge-functions performance", 3000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/openai/openai-node", "rate-limiting error-handling", 2000);

// For this specific feature, also load:
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss", "production-builds optimization", 2000);

// 2. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// 3. REVIEW integration patterns from other teams:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("IntegrationService", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("/src/lib/integrations/");

// NOW you have current docs + integration context. Agents can work intelligently!
```

**WHY THIS ORDER MATTERS:**
- Context7 ensures production-ready code patterns
- Serena shows integration points with other team outputs
- Agents work with complete system knowledge for final integration

---

## 🚀 STEP 2: LAUNCH PARALLEL AGENTS (AFTER documentation loaded!)

**NOW that you have current docs, launch agents with specific knowledge:**

1. **task-tracker-coordinator** --think-hard --with-context7-docs "Final photography AI integration and deployment"
2. **ai-ml-engineer** --think-hard --use-loaded-docs "Production AI optimization and monitoring"
3. **performance-optimization-expert** --think-ultra-hard --follow-existing-patterns "Image processing and caching optimization" 
4. **security-compliance-officer** --think-ultra-hard --check-current-best-practices
5. **test-automation-architect** --e2e-focus --use-testing-patterns-from-docs
6. **playwright-visual-testing-specialist** --accessibility-first --production-validation
7. **code-quality-guardian** --production-ready --match-codebase-style

**AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:** "Use the Context7 docs loaded in Step 1. Focus on production readiness and team integration."

**AGENT USAGE TARGET:** >75% of session time in parallel execution

---

## 📋 STEP 3: DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (With loaded docs + agents)

### **EXPLORE PHASE (NO CODING!)**
- Read ALL team integration outputs from Round 2
- Understand complete system architecture
- Check all cross-team dependencies
- Review production deployment requirements
- Continue until system integration is FULLY understood

### **PLAN PHASE (THINK HARD!)**
- Create comprehensive integration plan
- Write production test cases FIRST (TDD)
- Plan monitoring and alerting strategies
- Consider production scalability requirements
- Don't rush - final integration requires precision

### **CODE PHASE (PARALLEL AGENTS!)**
- Write comprehensive tests before implementation
- Follow production-ready patterns
- Use Context7 examples for optimization
- Implement with parallel agents focusing on quality
- Focus on reliability, not just functionality

### **COMMIT PHASE (VERIFY EVERYTHING!)**
- Run all tests including integration scenarios
- Verify with comprehensive Playwright testing
- Create complete evidence package
- Generate production readiness reports
- Only mark complete when PRODUCTION READY
