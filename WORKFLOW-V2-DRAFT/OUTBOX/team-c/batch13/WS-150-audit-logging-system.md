### DEPENDENCIES:
- Team B provides audit service foundation
- Team A requires WebSocket client integration
- External service credentials and configuration

### SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- [ ] WebSocket streams deliver events with <100ms latency
- [ ] External integrations work reliably with proper error handling
- [ ] Middleware adds minimal performance overhead
- [ ] Alert notifications reach appropriate channels
- [ ] Connection management handles network interruptions

### NOTES:
Focus on **reliability and performance**. Real-time audit streaming is critical for security monitoring. Implement proper error handling, reconnection logic, and ensure events are never lost.
