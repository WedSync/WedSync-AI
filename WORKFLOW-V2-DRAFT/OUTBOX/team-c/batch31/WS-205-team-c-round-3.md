## 🎯 USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding supplier using the complete integrated real-time platform
**I want to:** Seamless broadcast integration with channels, presence, AI insights, and contextual help
**So that:** Every notification I receive is perfectly timed, relevant, and enhanced with all available context

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
The photographer receives a broadcast about weather changes. The system automatically: shows this in the active wedding channel, includes presence status of all affected vendors, provides AI-suggested response actions, and offers relevant FAQ links about weather contingencies. When switching to a different wedding channel, broadcasts are contextually filtered to show only what's relevant to that specific wedding. The entire experience feels like one intelligent, cohesive communication system.
