# TEAM C — BATCH 29 — ROUND 3 — WS-199 — Rate Limiting System — Production Scale & Integration

**Date:** 2025-01-20  
**Feature ID:** WS-199 (Track all work with this ID)  
**Priority:** P0 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Complete rate limiting system for production scale with full team integration and enterprise performance  
**Context:** You are Team C working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete for production deployment.

## 🎯 USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** WedSync platform performance engineer preparing rate limiting for production scale  
**I want to:** Finalize rate limiting integration with all platform systems and validate enterprise-scale performance  
**So that:** I can guarantee that when 50,000+ concurrent users access the platform during peak wedding season, the rate limiting system will maintain fair resource allocation while preventing abuse; during viral social media spikes that drive 1000% traffic increases, the adaptive system will automatically scale limits to maintain service quality; and when wedding vendors and couples depend on platform availability for time-sensitive wedding coordination, the rate limiting will ensure consistent performance without blocking legitimate activities

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
During the platform's first viral marketing success, a celebrity wedding planner shares WedSync on social media, causing immediate traffic to spike from 1,000 to 15,000 concurrent users. The production-ready rate limiting system instantly detects the spike, applies ML-based adaptive limits that distinguish between legitimate couples seeking wedding vendors and automated scrapers, dynamically scales premium supplier limits to handle increased consultation requests, and maintains 99.9% availability while processing 50,000+ authentic wedding-related API calls per minute without degrading service for existing users.

## 🌐 BROWSER MCP INTERACTIVE TESTING (NEW!)

**🚀 Real Browser Automation with Browser MCP:**

The Browser MCP provides interactive browser testing capabilities that complement Playwright MCP:

```javascript
// BROWSER MCP - Interactive Visual Testing
// Use for real-time UI validation and user flow testing

// 1. NAVIGATE AND CAPTURE STATE
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/dashboard"});
const snapshot = await mcp__browsermcp__browser_snapshot();

// 2. INTERACTIVE FORM TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_click({
  element: "Login button",
  ref: snapshot.querySelector('[data-testid="login-btn"]')
});

await mcp__browsermcp__browser_type({
  element: "Email input field", 
  ref: snapshot.querySelector('input[type="email"]'),
  text: "test@wedding.com",
  submit: false
});

// 3. VISUAL REGRESSION TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_screenshot(); // Captures current state

// 4. RESPONSIVE TESTING
for (const width of [375, 768, 1024, 1920]) {
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_resize({width, height: 800});
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_wait({time: 1});
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_screenshot();
}

// 5. CONSOLE AND NETWORK MONITORING
const logs = await mcp__browsermcp__browser_get_console_logs();
const hasErrors = logs.some(log => log.level === 'error');

// 6. MULTI-TAB TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_tabs({action: "new"});
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/settings"});
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_tabs({action: "select", index: 0});
```

**Browser MCP vs Playwright MCP:**
- **Browser MCP**: Interactive, visual, real-time testing during development
- **Playwright MCP**: Automated, programmatic, CI/CD testing
- **Use Both**: Browser MCP for exploration, Playwright MCP for automation
