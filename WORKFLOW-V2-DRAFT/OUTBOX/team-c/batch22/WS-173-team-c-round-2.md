# TEAM C - ROUND 2: WS-173 - Performance Optimization Targets - Integration & CDN Optimization

**Date:** 2025-08-28  
**Feature ID:** WS-173 (Track all work with this ID)  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical for mobile usage)  
**Mission:** Integrate performance optimizations across all systems and implement CDN strategies  
**Context:** You are Team C building on Round 1's foundation. ALL teams must complete before Round 3.

## ðŸŽ¯ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding supplier using WedSync on mobile at venues  
**I want to:** Fast loading pages even on slow 3G connections  
**So that:** I can quickly access client information during time-sensitive wedding coordination  

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**  
Wedding venues often have poor internet connectivity. Suppliers need assets (images, documents, forms) to load instantly from the nearest CDN edge location, regardless of their geographic location.

## ðŸ“š STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION

```typescript
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "CDN edge caching strategies Next.js static assets"});
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "Supabase realtime performance optimization"});
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "Asset optimization progressive loading"});
```

## ðŸš€ STEP 2: LAUNCH PARALLEL AGENTS

1. **integration-specialist** --cdn-optimization "Implement CDN caching and asset optimization"
2. **performance-optimization-expert** --asset-delivery "Optimize asset delivery pipeline"
3. **devops-sre-engineer** --edge-caching "Configure edge caching strategies"
4. **test-automation-architect** --integration-testing "Cross-system performance testing"

## ðŸŽ¯ ROUND 2 DELIVERABLES

### **CDN & ASSET OPTIMIZATION:**
- [ ] CDN configuration for static assets
- [ ] Progressive image loading implementation
- [ ] Asset bundling and compression optimization
- [ ] Edge caching strategy for API responses
- [ ] Geographic performance optimization
- [ ] Asset preloading for critical resources

### **SYSTEM INTEGRATION:**
- [ ] Integration with Team A's component optimizations
- [ ] Integration with Team B's backend caching
- [ ] Real-time system performance optimization
- [ ] Cross-system performance monitoring
- [ ] End-to-end performance validation

**Evidence Package Required:**
- CDN performance metrics across geographic regions
- Asset loading time improvements
- Integration test results
- Cross-system performance benchmarks
