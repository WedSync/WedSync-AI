# TEAM A - ROUND 1: WS-194 - Environment Management - Environment Dashboard Frontend

**Date:** 2025-01-20  
**Feature ID:** WS-194 (Track all work with this ID)  
**Priority:** P0 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Build environment management dashboard frontend with real-time validation status, configuration validation, and admin interface for DevOps teams  
**Context:** You are Team A working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before next round.

---

## üéØ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** WedSync DevOps engineer managing deployments across multiple environments
**I want to:** View environment status in a comprehensive dashboard with validation results, secret rotation schedules, and configuration health indicators  
**So that:** I can prevent deployment failures during peak wedding season when 500+ couples depend on vendor coordination, quickly identify configuration issues before they affect wedding day logistics, and ensure all environments maintain proper security standards for sensitive wedding data

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
During June wedding peak, a configuration error in staging caused the production deployment to fail just hours before a venue's wedding coordination system needed to process 15 concurrent events. The environment dashboard would have shown the configuration mismatch, invalid database URLs, and missing API keys before deployment, preventing couples from losing access to vendor timeline updates on their wedding day.

---

## üéØ TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

**From Technical Specification:**
- Environment validation dashboard with real-time status monitoring and configuration health checks
- Secret rotation scheduling with automated alerts for due rotations and security compliance

## üß† SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP FOR COMPLEX FEATURE ANALYSIS

### When to Use Sequential Thinking

Before diving into coding, use Sequential Thinking MCP when facing:

- **Complex Feature Architecture**: Multi-component systems with intricate dependencies
- **Integration Challenges**: Features that span multiple systems and require coordination  
- **Business Logic Complexity**: Wedding-specific rules that need careful analysis
- **Technical Trade-offs**: Choosing between multiple implementation approaches
- **Debugging Complex Issues**: Root cause analysis for multi-system problems

### Sequential Thinking Patterns for Development Teams

#### Pattern 1: Feature Architecture Analysis
```typescript
// Before starting complex feature development
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This task tracking feature needs to integrate with existing task creation (WS-156), helper assignment (WS-157), and real-time notifications. Need to analyze data flow and identify potential integration points.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Data flow analysis: User creates task -> assigns helpers -> helpers update status -> triggers notifications -> updates progress indicators. Each step requires API endpoints, validation, and error handling.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

#### Pattern 2: Integration Strategy Planning  
```typescript
// When coordinating with other teams' work
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Team A is building UI components, Team C is handling real-time updates, and Team E is implementing testing. Need to define clear API contracts and data structures that all teams can use.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 3
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "API contract definition: /api/tasks/status endpoints need to support CRUD operations, validation schemas, and webhook events. Response format should match Team A's UI expectations.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 3
});
```

#### Pattern 3: Business Logic Analysis
```typescript
// When implementing wedding-specific business rules
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding task tracking has unique requirements: tasks can be delegated to multiple helpers, status updates need photo evidence for critical tasks, and deadlines are tied to wedding date proximity.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Business rule implementation: Critical tasks (venue confirmation, catering numbers) require photo evidence. Non-critical tasks (decoration pickup) can be marked complete without evidence. Need validation logic for each task type.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

### Using Sequential Thinking in Your Development Process

1. **Before Documentation Loading**: Use Sequential Thinking to understand the full scope and complexity
2. **During Planning Phase**: Structure your approach to handle all edge cases and integration points  
3. **When Stuck**: Use Sequential Thinking to work through complex problems systematically
4. **For Reviews**: Use Sequential Thinking to verify your implementation covers all requirements

**Remember**: Complex features require systematic thinking. Use Sequential Thinking MCP to ensure thorough analysis before implementation.

## üìö STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. LOAD CORRECT UI STYLE GUIDE (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK):
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. Ref MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "Next.js 15 App Router Server Components forms latest"});
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "Supabase realtime database auth latest documentation"});
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "Tailwind CSS v4 components styling patterns"});
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "React 19 hooks patterns best practices"});

// 3. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// 4. REVIEW existing admin dashboard patterns:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("AdminDashboard", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/components/admin");
```

### Navigation Implementation Requirements

**1. Breadcrumb Integration**
```tsx
// Add breadcrumb support to all new pages/components
import { Breadcrumb } from '@/components/ui/breadcrumb'

// Example breadcrumb hierarchy for this feature:
// Dashboard > Helpers > Schedules > [Helper Name] > [Schedule Details]
const breadcrumbItems = [
  { label: 'Dashboard', href: '/dashboard' },
  { label: 'Helpers', href: '/helpers' },
  { label: 'Schedules', href: '/helpers/schedules' },
  { label: helperName, href: `/helpers/schedules/${helperId}` },

]
```

**2. Menu Integration Points**
- **Main Navigation**: Add/update relevant menu items in main navigation
- **Contextual Menus**: Implement context-sensitive navigation options
- **Quick Actions**: Provide navigation shortcuts for common workflows

**3. Mobile Navigation Considerations**
```tsx
// Ensure mobile-first responsive navigation

- FROM Team C: Vercel integration data including deployment status and environment configuration - Required for environment health indicators  
- FROM Team D: Configuration UI components and environment switching interfaces - Required for admin dashboard integration

### What other teams NEED from you:
- TO Team B: Dashboard component contracts and status display interfaces - They need this for validation result integration
- TO Team D: Environment dashboard components and status visualization - Blocking their admin interface development
- TO Team E: Dashboard component test interfaces - Required for their comprehensive testing framework

---

## üîí SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### MANDATORY SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION FOR ENVIRONMENT DASHBOARD

**EVERY dashboard component MUST use the security framework at `/src/lib/validation/` and `/src/lib/security/`:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS (MANDATORY PATTERN FOR ADMIN DASHBOARDS):
import { withSecureAdminAccess } from '@/lib/validation/middleware';
import { environmentDashboardSchema } from '@/lib/validation/schemas';

// Admin dashboard with proper security validation
export const EnvironmentDashboard = withSecureAdminAccess(
  async (user: AdminUser) => {
    // User is validated admin with environment access
    // Dashboard implementation here
  }
);
```

### SECURITY CHECKLIST FOR ENVIRONMENT DASHBOARD

Teams MUST implement ALL of these for EVERY dashboard component:

- [ ] **Admin Authentication**: Use existing middleware from `/src/middleware.ts` with admin role validation
- [ ] **Environment Access Control**: MANDATORY role-based access for environment viewing and configuration
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Dashboard API calls must respect rate limits - DO NOT bypass existing middleware
- [ ] **CSRF Protection**: All admin forms use CSRF tokens - automatic via middleware
- [ ] **Input Sanitization**: All environment data display uses XSS prevention - see `/src/lib/security/input-validation.ts`
- [ ] **Secret Protection**: NEVER display actual secret values - show masked/hashed versions only
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: All admin actions logged - use existing audit framework
- [ ] **Session Security**: Admin sessions have shorter timeout and proper invalidation
- [ ] **Error Handling**: NEVER expose environment configuration details in error messages to non-admin users

---

## üé≠ REVOLUTIONARY PLAYWRIGHT MCP TESTING (MANDATORY)

```javascript
// Environment dashboard testing with real-time status validation
await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/admin/environments"});

## üåê BROWSER MCP INTERACTIVE TESTING (NEW!)

**üöÄ Real Browser Automation with Browser MCP:**

The Browser MCP provides interactive browser testing capabilities that complement Playwright MCP:

```javascript
// BROWSER MCP - Interactive Visual Testing
// Use for real-time UI validation and user flow testing

// 1. NAVIGATE AND CAPTURE STATE
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/dashboard"});
const snapshot = await mcp__browsermcp__browser_snapshot();

// 2. INTERACTIVE FORM TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_click({
  element: "Login button",
  ref: snapshot.querySelector('[data-testid="login-btn"]')
});

await mcp__browsermcp__browser_type({
  element: "Email input field", 
  ref: snapshot.querySelector('input[type="email"]'),
  text: "test@wedding.com",
  submit: false
});

// 3. VISUAL REGRESSION TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_screenshot(); // Captures current state

// 4. RESPONSIVE TESTING
for (const width of [375, 768, 1024, 1920]) {
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_resize({width, height: 800});
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_wait({time: 1});
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_screenshot();
}

// 5. CONSOLE AND NETWORK MONITORING
const logs = await mcp__browsermcp__browser_get_console_logs();
const hasErrors = logs.some(log => log.level === 'error');

// 6. MULTI-TAB TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_tabs({action: "new"});
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/settings"});
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_tabs({action: "select", index: 0});
```

**Browser MCP vs Playwright MCP:**
- **Browser MCP**: Interactive, visual, real-time testing during development
