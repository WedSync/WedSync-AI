# TEAM A — BATCH 29 — ROUND 2 — WS-197 — Middleware Setup — Advanced Security & Performance

**Date:** 2025-01-20  
**Feature ID:** WS-197 (Track all work with this ID)  
**Priority:** P0 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Enhance middleware with advanced security features, performance optimizations, and comprehensive testing integration  
**Context:** You are Team A working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before next round.

## 🎯 USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** WedSync platform security engineer implementing advanced middleware protection  
**I want to:** Add advanced security features including bot detection, suspicious activity monitoring, and performance optimizations for high-traffic scenarios  
**So that:** I can ensure that during peak wedding season when 1000+ concurrent users are accessing supplier portfolios and submitting forms, the middleware can detect and block malicious bot traffic while maintaining sub-10ms response times; protect against sophisticated attacks like session fixation and CSRF bypass attempts; and provide detailed security analytics for monitoring platform health during critical wedding coordination periods

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
During a major bridal show weekend, WedSync experiences a 500% traffic spike as couples browse supplier portfolios and submit consultation requests. The advanced middleware detects automated bot scraping attempts, blocks them with progressive penalties, while ensuring legitimate couples experience fast, secure access to wedding vendor information. Real-time monitoring shows 99.9% uptime with average response times under 8ms, ensuring couples can submit their wedding requirements without delays during this critical discovery phase.

## 📚 STEP 1: ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION LOADING

```typescript
// ROUND 2 ADVANCED PATTERNS:
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "next middleware performance latest documentation"});
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "security csrf-protection advanced latest documentation"});
await mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation({query: "workers bot-detection latest documentation"});

// Review Round 1 implementations:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("middleware", "lib/middleware", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("middleware.ts");
```


## 🌐 BROWSER MCP INTERACTIVE TESTING (NEW!)

**🚀 Real Browser Automation with Browser MCP:**

The Browser MCP provides interactive browser testing capabilities that complement Playwright MCP:

```javascript
// BROWSER MCP - Interactive Visual Testing
// Use for real-time UI validation and user flow testing

// 1. NAVIGATE AND CAPTURE STATE
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/dashboard"});
const snapshot = await mcp__browsermcp__browser_snapshot();

// 2. INTERACTIVE FORM TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_click({
  element: "Login button",
  ref: snapshot.querySelector('[data-testid="login-btn"]')
});

await mcp__browsermcp__browser_type({
  element: "Email input field", 
  ref: snapshot.querySelector('input[type="email"]'),
  text: "test@wedding.com",
  submit: false
});

// 3. VISUAL REGRESSION TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_screenshot(); // Captures current state

// 4. RESPONSIVE TESTING
for (const width of [375, 768, 1024, 1920]) {
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_resize({width, height: 800});
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_wait({time: 1});
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_screenshot();
}

// 5. CONSOLE AND NETWORK MONITORING
const logs = await mcp__browsermcp__browser_get_console_logs();
const hasErrors = logs.some(log => log.level === 'error');

// 6. MULTI-TAB TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_tabs({action: "new"});
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/settings"});
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_tabs({action: "select", index: 0});
```

**Browser MCP vs Playwright MCP:**
- **Browser MCP**: Interactive, visual, real-time testing during development
- **Playwright MCP**: Automated, programmatic, CI/CD testing
- **Use Both**: Browser MCP for exploration, Playwright MCP for automation

## 🧭 NAVIGATION INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

**Critical Navigation Context:**
This feature must integrate seamlessly with WedSync's navigation system to provide intuitive user flows and maintain consistent user experience across all wedding management workflows.

### Navigation Implementation Requirements

**1. Breadcrumb Integration**
```tsx
// Add breadcrumb support to all new pages/components
import { Breadcrumb } from '@/components/ui/breadcrumb'

// Example breadcrumb hierarchy for this feature:
// Dashboard > Helpers > Schedules > [Helper Name] > [Schedule Details]
const breadcrumbItems = [
  { label: 'Dashboard', href: '/dashboard' },
  { label: 'Helpers', href: '/helpers' },
  { label: 'Schedules', href: '/helpers/schedules' },
  { label: helperName, href: `/helpers/schedules/${helperId}` },
  { label: 'Details', href: undefined } // current page
]
```

**2. Menu Integration Points**
- **Main Navigation**: Add/update relevant menu items in main navigation
- **Contextual Menus**: Implement context-sensitive navigation options
- **Quick Actions**: Provide navigation shortcuts for common workflows

**3. Mobile Navigation Considerations**
```tsx
// Ensure mobile-first responsive navigation
// Use progressive disclosure for complex navigation trees
// Implement touch-friendly navigation controls
// Consider swipe gestures for timeline/schedule navigation
```

**4. Navigation State Management**
```tsx
// Implement navigation state persistence
// Handle deep linking and shareable URLs
// Maintain navigation context across page refreshes
// Support browser back/forward functionality
```

**5. User Flow Integration**
- **Entry Points**: Define how users access this feature from existing workflows
- **Exit Points**: Provide clear paths to related features and main dashboard
- **Cross-Feature Navigation**: Enable seamless transitions between related features

**6. Wedding Context Navigation**
```tsx
// Maintain wedding context in navigation
// Support multi-wedding navigation switching
// Preserve user's current wedding selection across feature navigation
// Implement wedding-specific navigation shortcuts
```

**Navigation Testing Requirements:**
- Test all breadcrumb paths and hierarchy
- Verify mobile navigation responsiveness
- Validate deep linking functionality
