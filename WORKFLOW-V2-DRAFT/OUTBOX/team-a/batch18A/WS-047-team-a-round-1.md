# TEAM A - ROUND 1: WS-047 - Review Collection System - Frontend Components & UI

**Date:** 2025-01-20  
**Feature ID:** WS-047 (Track all work with this ID)
**Priority:** P1 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Build the core review collection interface components for suppliers to manage automated review campaigns  
**Context:** You are Team A working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before next round.

## üéØ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding photographer who just completed a wedding
**I want to:** Automatically collect reviews 10 days post-wedding when couples are happiest
**So that:** I get 67% more bookings from online reviews instead of manually chasing testimonials for months

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Jake photographed Emma & Mike's wedding on June 15th. On June 25th, the system automatically sends Emma a personalized review request: "Hi Emma! Hope you're still glowing from your beautiful ceremony at Sunset Manor! Would you mind sharing your experience with Jake?" One-click takes her to a pre-filled form with her wedding details, she leaves a 5-star Google review, and Jake gets 3 inquiries that week from couples who found him through that review.

## üéØ TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

**From Technical Specification:**
This is a core SAAS feature that helps suppliers automatically collect positive reviews to grow their business. It's NOT lead generation for new clients - it's about showcasing success stories from completed weddings to attract future couples.

**Technology Stack (VERIFIED):**
- Frontend: Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4
- Database: PostgreSQL via MCP Server (‚úÖ CONNECTED - Direct Supabase access available)
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL 15), Edge Functions
- Testing: Playwright MCP, Vitest

**Integration Points:**
- Review Campaigns: Campaign management interface
- Analytics Dashboard: Performance metrics display
- Platform Integrations: Google Business, Facebook connections

## üìö STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. LOAD CORRECT UI STYLE GUIDE (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK):
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. REF MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
# Use Ref MCP to search for:
# - "Next.js App Router forms server actions"
# - "React Hook Form validation patterns"
# - "Tailwind CSS responsive components"
# - "React 19 concurrent features"

// 3. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// 4. REVIEW existing patterns before creating new ones:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("Dashboard", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/components/ui");
```

## üöÄ STEP 2: LAUNCH PARALLEL AGENTS (AFTER documentation loaded!)

1. **task-tracker-coordinator** --think-hard --with-ref-docs "Review collection UI components"
2. **react-ui-specialist** --think-hard --use-loaded-docs "React 19 form components with server actions"
3. **ui-ux-designer** --think-ultra-hard --follow-existing-patterns "Review campaign management interface" 
4. **security-compliance-officer** --think-ultra-hard --check-current-best-practices
5. **test-automation-architect** --tdd-approach --use-testing-patterns-from-docs
6. **playwright-visual-testing-specialist** --accessibility-first --multi-tab
7. **code-quality-guardian** --check-patterns --match-codebase-style

---

## üìã STEP 3: DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### **EXPLORE PHASE (NO CODING!)**
- Read ALL relevant files first in `/src/components/`
- Understand existing dashboard patterns and form components
- Check integration points with analytics and settings
- Review similar implementations for campaigns or automated systems
- Continue until you FULLY understand the codebase patterns

### **PLAN PHASE (THINK HARD!)**
- Create detailed implementation plan for review collection UI
- Write test cases FIRST (TDD approach)
- Plan responsive design for mobile suppliers
- Consider accessibility requirements
- Plan component architecture and state management

### **CODE PHASE (PARALLEL AGENTS!)**
- Write tests before implementation
- Follow existing patterns from loaded documentation
- Use Ref MCP examples as templates for forms
- Implement with parallel agents
- Focus on completeness, not speed

```typescript
// ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS (MANDATORY PATTERN):
import { withSecureValidation } from '@/lib/validation/middleware';
import { reviewCampaignSchema } from '@/lib/validation/schemas';

// All form submissions must use validated server actions
export const createReviewCampaign = withSecureValidation(
  reviewCampaignSchema,
  async (request: NextRequest, validatedData) => {
    // Implementation with validated data
  }
);
```

### SECURITY CHECKLIST FOR ALL COMPONENTS:

// 2. RESPONSIVE VALIDATION (All Breakpoints)
for (const width of [375, 768, 1920]) {
  await mcp__playwright__browser_resize({width, height: 800});
  await mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot();
  await mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot({filename: `${width}px-review-dashboard.png`});
}

// 3. FORM INTERACTION TESTING
await mcp__playwright__browser_type({
