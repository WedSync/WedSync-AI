## ðŸŽ¯ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding venue coordinator on day 28 of my trial
**I want to:** See exactly what value I received and seamlessly convert to a paid plan
**So that:** I don't lose any data or momentum in managing my upcoming weddings

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
The coordinator has 3 weddings next month fully configured in WedSync. The trial ending dashboard shows they saved 42 hours, automated 156 tasks, and coordinated with 28 suppliers. One-click conversion preserves everything with no disruption to their wedding workflows.
