## ðŸŽ¯ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding venue coordinator in week 2 of my trial
**I want to:** See my progress, get helpful tips, and understand which features save me the most time
**So that:** I can maximize my trial period and make an informed decision about subscribing

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
The coordinator has imported weddings but isn't using key features. Smart prompts guide them to try automated timelines for their next wedding, showing them exactly how much time they'll save. Activity tracking helps identify power users for conversion.
