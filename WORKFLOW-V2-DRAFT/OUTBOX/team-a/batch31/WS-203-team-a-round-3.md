## üéØ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding supplier using the complete real-time system
**I want to:** Seamless integration between channels, presence tracking, and broadcast events
**So that:** The entire real-time communication system feels like one cohesive experience

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
The photographer sees Sarah's wedding channel with 3 unread messages, notices the venue coordinator is online (green dot), receives a broadcast about weather changes affecting all outdoor weddings, and gets presence updates when team members join/leave channels. All of this happens smoothly without UI glitches, loading delays, or broken features. The system feels professional and reliable for managing multiple concurrent weddings.

## üìö STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. LOAD CORRECT UI STYLE GUIDE (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK):
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. REF MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
// Use Ref MCP to search for:
// - "React component composition patterns"
// - "Performance optimization React 19"
// - "Production deployment checklist Next.js"

// For this specific feature, also search:
// - "Real-time application testing strategies"
// - "WebSocket production monitoring"

// 3. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// 4. REVIEW all rounds and team integrations:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("ChannelManager", "", true);
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("PresenceIndicator", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("/src/components/websocket");
```

// Step 1: Join a channel and verify presence
await mcp__playwright__browser_click({
  element: "wedding channel",
  ref: "[data-testid='channel-sarah-wedding']"
});

// Verify presence indicator shows user is active
await mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for({text: "Online"});
