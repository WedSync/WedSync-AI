# TEAM A - ROUND 2: WS-153 - Photo Groups Management - Advanced UI & Integration

**Date:** 2025-08-25  
**Feature ID:** WS-153 (Track all work with this ID)  
**Priority:** P1 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Enhance photo group UI with advanced features and integrate with Team B's APIs  
**Context:** You are Team A working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before next round.

## üéØ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding couple organizing photo sessions
**I want to:** Advanced photo group management with scheduling and conflict resolution
**So that:** My photographer can efficiently manage complex photo session logistics without timing conflicts

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Building on Round 1's basic grouping, couples now need to schedule photo sessions with time slots, detect conflicts when the same person is in multiple overlapping groups, and provide photographer-specific notes for optimal session planning.

---

## üéØ TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

**From Technical Specification & Round 1 Foundation:**
- Integration with Team B's API endpoints for photo groups
- Advanced conflict detection UI with visual warnings
- Photo session scheduling with time slot management
- Priority-based group organization and reordering
- Photographer notes interface and location preferences
- Real-time updates when groups are modified

**Technology Stack (VERIFIED):**
- Frontend: Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4
- Database: PostgreSQL via MCP Server (‚úÖ CONNECTED - Direct Supabase access available)
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL 15), Edge Functions
- Testing: Playwright MCP, Vitest
- Real-time: Supabase Realtime subscriptions

**Integration Points:**
- **Team B APIs**: Integrate with completed photo group CRUD endpoints
- **Team C Database**: Use established schema and migrations
- **Real-time Updates**: Supabase subscriptions for live group changes
- **WS-151 Integration**: Enhanced guest list connectivity

## üìö STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Complete this BEFORE any coding or agent work begins!**

```typescript
// 1. LOAD CORRECT UI STYLE GUIDE (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI WORK):
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. CONTEXT7 MCP - Load latest docs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK:
await mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("next.js");  
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/vercel/next.js", "app-router server-actions api-integration", 5000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/supabase/supabase", "realtime subscriptions broadcasting", 3000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss", "advanced-ui scheduling-components", 2000);

// 2. SERENA MCP - Initialize codebase intelligence:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);

// 3. REVIEW Round 1 implementation:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("PhotoGroupManager", "", true);
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("PhotoGroupBuilder", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("src/components/guests");
```
