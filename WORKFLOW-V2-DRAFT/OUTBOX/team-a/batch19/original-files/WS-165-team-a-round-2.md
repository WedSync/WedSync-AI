## 🎯 USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding couple managing payment deadlines
**I want to:** Advanced calendar features like recurring payments, payment grouping, and visual cash flow indicators
**So that:** I can better visualize my payment timeline and optimize my wedding budget cash flow

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Beyond basic payment tracking, couples need to see payment patterns, group related payments (all venue payments together), and understand their cash flow over time. Round 2 adds sophisticated visualization and grouping features that help couples make better financial decisions.

## 🧭 NAVIGATION INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

**Critical Navigation Context:**
This feature must integrate seamlessly with WedSync's navigation system to provide intuitive user flows and maintain consistent user experience across all wedding management workflows.

### Navigation Implementation Requirements

**1. Breadcrumb Integration**
```tsx
// Add breadcrumb support to all new pages/components
import { Breadcrumb } from '@/components/ui/breadcrumb'

// Example breadcrumb hierarchy for this feature:
// Dashboard > Helpers > Schedules > [Helper Name] > [Schedule Details]
const breadcrumbItems = [
  { label: 'Dashboard', href: '/dashboard' },
  { label: 'Helpers', href: '/helpers' },
  { label: 'Schedules', href: '/helpers/schedules' },
  { label: helperName, href: `/helpers/schedules/${helperId}` },
  { label: 'Details', href: undefined } // current page
]
```

**2. Menu Integration Points**
- **Main Navigation**: Add/update relevant menu items in main navigation
- **Contextual Menus**: Implement context-sensitive navigation options
- **Quick Actions**: Provide navigation shortcuts for common workflows

**3. Mobile Navigation Considerations**
```tsx
// Ensure mobile-first responsive navigation
// Use progressive disclosure for complex navigation trees
// Implement touch-friendly navigation controls
// Consider swipe gestures for timeline/schedule navigation
```

**4. Navigation State Management**
```tsx
// Implement navigation state persistence
// Handle deep linking and shareable URLs
// Maintain navigation context across page refreshes
// Support browser back/forward functionality
```

**5. User Flow Integration**
- **Entry Points**: Define how users access this feature from existing workflows
- **Exit Points**: Provide clear paths to related features and main dashboard
- **Cross-Feature Navigation**: Enable seamless transitions between related features

**6. Wedding Context Navigation**
```tsx
// Maintain wedding context in navigation
// Support multi-wedding navigation switching
// Preserve user's current wedding selection across feature navigation
// Implement wedding-specific navigation shortcuts
```

**Navigation Testing Requirements:**
- Test all breadcrumb paths and hierarchy
- Verify mobile navigation responsiveness
- Validate deep linking functionality
- Test navigation state persistence
- Ensure keyboard navigation accessibility
- Verify screen reader navigation support

## 🔗 DEPENDENCIES & INTEGRATION

### What you NEED from other teams (Round 1 outputs):
- FROM Team B: Enhanced payment APIs with grouping - Required for advanced features
- FROM Team C: Reminder preference settings - Needed for UI integration
- FROM Team D: Mobile optimization patterns - Required for responsive enhancement

### What other teams NEED from you:
- TO Team E: Enhanced component testing interfaces - For comprehensive testing
- TO Team C: Payment UI state management - For notification integration


## 🌐 BROWSER MCP INTERACTIVE TESTING (NEW!)

**🚀 Real Browser Automation with Browser MCP:**

The Browser MCP provides interactive browser testing capabilities that complement Playwright MCP:

```javascript
// BROWSER MCP - Interactive Visual Testing
// Use for real-time UI validation and user flow testing

// 1. NAVIGATE AND CAPTURE STATE
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/dashboard"});
const snapshot = await mcp__browsermcp__browser_snapshot();

// 2. INTERACTIVE FORM TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_click({
  element: "Login button",
  ref: snapshot.querySelector('[data-testid="login-btn"]')
});

await mcp__browsermcp__browser_type({
  element: "Email input field", 
  ref: snapshot.querySelector('input[type="email"]'),
  text: "test@wedding.com",
  submit: false
});

// 3. VISUAL REGRESSION TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_screenshot(); // Captures current state

// 4. RESPONSIVE TESTING
for (const width of [375, 768, 1024, 1920]) {
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_resize({width, height: 800});
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_wait({time: 1});
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_screenshot();
}

// 5. CONSOLE AND NETWORK MONITORING
const logs = await mcp__browsermcp__browser_get_console_logs();
const hasErrors = logs.some(log => log.level === 'error');

// 6. MULTI-TAB TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_tabs({action: "new"});
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/settings"});
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_tabs({action: "select", index: 0});
```

**Browser MCP vs Playwright MCP:**
- **Browser MCP**: Interactive, visual, real-time testing during development
- **Playwright MCP**: Automated, programmatic, CI/CD testing
- **Use Both**: Browser MCP for exploration, Playwright MCP for automation
