# TEAM A - ROUND 1: WS-165/166 - Payment Calendar & Pricing Strategy System - Core Implementation

**Date:** 2025-08-25  
**Feature IDs:** WS-165, WS-166 (Combined batch development)
**Priority:** P1 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Build comprehensive payment calendar and pricing table components for wedding management and supplier subscriptions
**Context:** You are Team A working in parallel with 4 other teams. Combined features for efficient development.

---

## üéØ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**WS-165 - Payment Calendar:**
**As a:** Wedding couple managing payment deadlines
**I want to:** View upcoming payment due dates on a calendar with automatic reminders
**So that:** I never miss important payment deadlines and can plan cash flow effectively

**WS-166 - Pricing Strategy System:**
**As a:** Wedding supplier (photographer/venue/florist)
**I want to:** Choose a subscription plan that matches my business size and needs
**So that:** I can access the right features at the right price point and scale as my business grows

**Real Wedding Problems These Solve:**
1. **Payment Calendar**: Couples currently track wedding payments in spreadsheets and phone notes, missing critical deadlines like venue final payments or photographer deposits. This creates a visual payment calendar with automatic reminders.
2. **Pricing Strategy**: A wedding photographer manages 30 weddings/year but uses spreadsheets. With the starter tier at ¬£19/month, they can manage all clients digitally, saving 5+ hours per wedding. As they grow to 50+ weddings, they upgrade to Professional for automation features.

## üß† SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP FOR COMPLEX FEATURE ANALYSIS

### When to Use Sequential Thinking

Before diving into coding, use Sequential Thinking MCP when facing:

- **Complex Feature Architecture**: Multi-component systems with intricate dependencies
- **Integration Challenges**: Features that span multiple systems and require coordination  
- **Business Logic Complexity**: Wedding-specific rules that need careful analysis
- **Technical Trade-offs**: Choosing between multiple implementation approaches
- **Debugging Complex Issues**: Root cause analysis for multi-system problems

### Sequential Thinking Patterns for Development Teams

#### Pattern 1: Feature Architecture Analysis
```typescript
// Before starting complex feature development
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This combined payment calendar and pricing system needs to integrate with budget categories, subscription management, and payment processing. Need to analyze data flow for both wedding couples and suppliers.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Data flow analysis: Payment calendar displays couple payment schedules while pricing system manages supplier subscriptions. Both use different authentication contexts and database schemas.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

#### Pattern 2: Integration Strategy Planning  
```typescript
// When coordinating with other teams' work
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Team A builds UI components, Team B provides payment/subscription APIs, Team C handles notifications. Need to define clear API contracts for both payment data and subscription management.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 3
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "API contract definition: /api/payments and /api/subscriptions endpoints need different validation schemas. Payment calendar requires date-based queries, pricing system needs tier comparison data.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 3
});
```

### Using Sequential Thinking in Your Development Process

1. **Before Documentation Loading**: Use Sequential Thinking to understand the full scope and complexity
2. **During Planning Phase**: Structure your approach to handle all edge cases and integration points  
3. **When Stuck**: Use Sequential Thinking to work through complex problems systematically
4. **For Reviews**: Use Sequential Thinking to verify your implementation covers all requirements

**Remember**: Complex features require systematic thinking. Use Sequential Thinking MCP to ensure thorough analysis before implementation.

## üåê BROWSER MCP INTERACTIVE TESTING (NEW!)

**üöÄ Real Browser Automation with Browser MCP:**

```javascript
// BROWSER MCP - Interactive Visual Testing for both features

// 1. PAYMENT CALENDAR TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/payments/calendar"});
const calendarSnapshot = await mcp__browsermcp__browser_snapshot();

// Test calendar navigation
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_click({
  element: "Next month button",
  ref: "[data-testid='calendar-next-month']"
});

// Test payment marking
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_click({
  element: "Mark as paid button",
  ref: "[data-payment-id='test-payment-1']"
});

// 2. PRICING TABLE TESTING  
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/pricing"});
const pricingSnapshot = await mcp__browsermcp__browser_snapshot();

// Test upgrade flow
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_click({
  element: "Upgrade to Professional button",
  ref: "[data-tier='professional'] button"
});

// Test modal interactions
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_wait_for({text: "Upgrade Subscription"});

// 3. RESPONSIVE TESTING FOR BOTH
for (const width of [375, 768, 1024, 1920]) {
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_resize({width, height: 800});
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/payments/calendar"});
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_screenshot({filename: `payment-calendar-${width}px.png`});
  
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/pricing"});
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_screenshot({filename: `pricing-table-${width}px.png`});
}

// 4. CONSOLE AND NETWORK MONITORING
const logs = await mcp__browsermcp__browser_get_console_logs();
const hasErrors = logs.some(log => log.level === 'error');
```

## üìã STEP 3: DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (With loaded docs + agents)

### **EXPLORE PHASE (NO CODING!)**
- Read existing calendar and pricing components in the codebase
- Understand existing payment/subscription patterns
- Check integration points with payment and subscription APIs
- Review similar date picker and pricing table implementations
- Continue until you FULLY understand the codebase patterns

### **PLAN PHASE (THINK HARD!)**
- Create detailed implementation plan for both payment calendar and pricing system
- Write test cases FIRST (TDD) for both feature sets
- Plan error handling for payment data and subscription flows
- Consider responsive breakpoints for both components
- Don't rush - proper planning prevents problems

### **CODE PHASE (PARALLEL AGENTS!)**
- Write tests before implementation
- Follow existing component patterns
- Use Ref MCP calendar and pricing examples as templates
- Implement with parallel agents
- Focus on completeness, not speed

## üîí SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### MANDATORY SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION FOR ALL API CALLS

```typescript
// ‚úÖ PAYMENT CALENDAR SECURITY PATTERN:
import { withSecureValidation } from '@/lib/validation/middleware';
import { paymentSchema } from '@/lib/validation/schemas';

const fetchPayments = async (coupleId: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/payments/${coupleId}`, {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'x-csrf-token': await getCsrfToken(),
    },
  });
  
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch payments');
  }
  
  return await response.json();
};

// ‚úÖ PRICING SYSTEM SECURITY PATTERN:
import { subscriptionSchema } from '@/lib/validation/schemas';

const upgradeSubscription = async (tierId: string, stripeData: any) => {
  const validatedData = subscriptionSchema.parse({
    tierId,
    stripeData,
    userId: session.user.id
  });
  
  const response = await fetch(`/api/subscriptions/upgrade`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'x-csrf-token': await getCsrfToken(),
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(validatedData)
  });
  
  return await response.json();
};
```

### SECURITY CHECKLIST FOR BOTH FEATURES:
- [ ] **Authentication Check**: Verify user session for both couples and suppliers
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Validate payment IDs, amounts, subscription tiers
- [ ] **CSRF Protection**: Include CSRF tokens in all state-changing operations
- [ ] **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries ONLY
- [ ] **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize payment descriptions and pricing content
- [ ] **PCI Compliance**: Secure handling of payment card data
