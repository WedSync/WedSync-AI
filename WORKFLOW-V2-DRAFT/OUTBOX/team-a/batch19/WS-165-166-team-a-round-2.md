---

## 🎯 USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**WS-165 - Enhanced Payment Calendar:**
**As a:** Wedding couple managing payment deadlines
**I want to:** Advanced calendar features like recurring payments, payment grouping, and visual cash flow indicators
**So that:** I can better visualize my payment timeline and optimize my wedding budget cash flow

**WS-166 - Enhanced Pricing Strategy System:**
**As a:** Wedding supplier considering subscription options
**I want to:** See dynamic pricing that reflects my actual usage and compare features with interactive demos
**So that:** I can make an informed decision about the best value subscription tier for my business

**Real Wedding Problems Enhanced Solutions:**
1. **Advanced Payment Calendar**: Beyond basic tracking, couples need payment patterns, grouping (all venue payments together), and cash flow visualization over time for better financial decisions.
2. **Dynamic Pricing System**: Suppliers need to see how pricing adapts to their usage patterns and compare features with interactive demos before committing to higher tiers.

## 🧠 SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP FOR COMPLEX FEATURE ANALYSIS

### Enhanced Sequential Thinking for Round 2

#### Pattern 1: Advanced Feature Integration Analysis
```typescript
// Complex multi-system integration planning
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Round 2 requires integrating advanced calendar features with payment analytics while simultaneously enhancing pricing system with dynamic calculations. Need to analyze how these systems interact and share data efficiently.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Data flow complexity: Payment calendar needs real-time cash flow calculations while pricing system requires usage analytics. Both systems need WebSocket connections but to different data streams.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 5
});
```

#### Pattern 2: Performance Optimization Strategy
```typescript
// When optimizing complex UI systems
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Payment calendar with 100+ payments and dynamic pricing with real-time calculations both need performance optimization. Calendar needs virtualization, pricing system needs efficient caching.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Optimization approach: Implement React.memo for payment items, useMemo for pricing calculations, and lazy loading for calendar months. Batch API calls and implement optimistic updates.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```
