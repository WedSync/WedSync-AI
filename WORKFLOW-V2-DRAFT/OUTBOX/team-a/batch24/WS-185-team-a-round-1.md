## 🎯 USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Couple searching for trustworthy wedding suppliers through the WedSync directory
**I want to:** See verified badges (business registration, insurance, portfolio authenticity) on supplier profiles so I can confidently hire legitimate professionals
**So that:** I can avoid wedding vendor scams, ensure proper insurance coverage, and trust that portfolio images are authentic work from the actual supplier

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
A couple found a photographer with stunning portfolio images but later discovered they were stolen from another photographer, resulting in a disastrous wedding day with an inexperienced amateur. The Verification Process System prevents this by running reverse image searches on portfolio images, verifying business registration through government APIs, and checking insurance certificates through OCR document processing, displaying trust badges that help couples identify legitimate professionals.

## 🌐 BROWSER MCP INTERACTIVE TESTING (NEW!)

**🚀 Real Browser Automation with Browser MCP:**

The Browser MCP provides interactive browser testing capabilities that complement Playwright MCP:

```javascript
// BROWSER MCP - Interactive Visual Testing
// Use for real-time UI validation and user flow testing

// 1. NAVIGATE AND CAPTURE STATE
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/dashboard"});
const snapshot = await mcp__browsermcp__browser_snapshot();

// 2. INTERACTIVE FORM TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_click({
  element: "Login button",
  ref: snapshot.querySelector('[data-testid="login-btn"]')
});

await mcp__browsermcp__browser_type({
  element: "Email input field", 
  ref: snapshot.querySelector('input[type="email"]'),
  text: "test@wedding.com",
  submit: false
});

// 3. VISUAL REGRESSION TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_screenshot(); // Captures current state

// 4. RESPONSIVE TESTING
for (const width of [375, 768, 1024, 1920]) {
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_resize({width, height: 800});
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_wait({time: 1});
  await mcp__browsermcp__browser_screenshot();
}

// 5. CONSOLE AND NETWORK MONITORING
const logs = await mcp__browsermcp__browser_get_console_logs();
const hasErrors = logs.some(log => log.level === 'error');

// 6. MULTI-TAB TESTING
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_tabs({action: "new"});
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/settings"});
await mcp__browsermcp__browser_tabs({action: "select", index: 0});
```

**Browser MCP vs Playwright MCP:**
- **Browser MCP**: Interactive, visual, real-time testing during development
- **Playwright MCP**: Automated, programmatic, CI/CD testing
- **Use Both**: Browser MCP for exploration, Playwright MCP for automation

## 🧭 NAVIGATION INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

**Critical Navigation Context:**
This feature must integrate seamlessly with WedSync's navigation system to provide intuitive user flows and maintain consistent user experience across all wedding management workflows.

### Navigation Implementation Requirements

**1. Breadcrumb Integration**
```tsx
// Add breadcrumb support to all new pages/components
import { Breadcrumb } from '@/components/ui/breadcrumb'

// Example breadcrumb hierarchy for this feature:
// Dashboard > Helpers > Schedules > [Helper Name] > [Schedule Details]
const breadcrumbItems = [
  { label: 'Dashboard', href: '/dashboard' },
  { label: 'Helpers', href: '/helpers' },
  { label: 'Schedules', href: '/helpers/schedules' },
  { label: helperName, href: `/helpers/schedules/${helperId}` },
  { label: 'Details', href: undefined } // current page
]
```

**2. Menu Integration Points**
- **Main Navigation**: Add/update relevant menu items in main navigation
- **Contextual Menus**: Implement context-sensitive navigation options
- **Quick Actions**: Provide navigation shortcuts for common workflows

**3. Mobile Navigation Considerations**
```tsx
// Ensure mobile-first responsive navigation
// Use progressive disclosure for complex navigation trees
// Implement touch-friendly navigation controls
// Consider swipe gestures for timeline/schedule navigation
```

**4. Navigation State Management**
```tsx
// Implement navigation state persistence
// Handle deep linking and shareable URLs
// Maintain navigation context across page refreshes
// Support browser back/forward functionality
```

**5. User Flow Integration**
- **Entry Points**: Define how users access this feature from existing workflows
- **Exit Points**: Provide clear paths to related features and main dashboard
- **Cross-Feature Navigation**: Enable seamless transitions between related features

**6. Wedding Context Navigation**
```tsx
// Maintain wedding context in navigation
// Support multi-wedding navigation switching
// Preserve user's current wedding selection across feature navigation
// Implement wedding-specific navigation shortcuts
```

**Navigation Testing Requirements:**
- Test all breadcrumb paths and hierarchy
- Verify mobile navigation responsiveness
- Validate deep linking functionality
- Test navigation state persistence
- Ensure keyboard navigation accessibility
- Verify screen reader navigation support
