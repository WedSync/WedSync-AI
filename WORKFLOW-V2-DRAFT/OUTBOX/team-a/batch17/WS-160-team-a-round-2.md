# TEAM A - ROUND 2: WS-160 - Master Timeline - Advanced Timeline Builder UI

**Date:** 2025-01-25  
**Feature ID:** WS-160 (Track all work with this ID)
**Priority:** P1 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Build advanced timeline builder interface with drag-drop scheduling and conflict detection  
**Context:** You are Team A working in parallel with 4 other teams. ALL must complete before next round.

---

## üéØ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding couple coordinating their wedding day schedule
**I want to:** Create a comprehensive timeline from getting ready to send-off with automatic time calculations and conflict detection
**So that:** All suppliers and helpers know exactly when and where to be, preventing delays and ensuring smooth transitions between events

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
A couple currently emails separate timeline documents to their photographer, DJ, caterer, and officiant, leading to conflicting schedules. With this feature, they create one master timeline where "Cocktail Hour 5:00pm-6:00pm" automatically calculates that "Reception Setup" must complete by 4:45pm with buffer time. All suppliers see the same synchronized schedule, eliminating the "I thought ceremony started at 4:30pm" confusion that causes wedding delays.

---

## üéØ TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

**From Technical Specification:**
- Build interactive timeline builder with drag-drop functionality
- Implement automatic time calculation and conflict detection
- Create timeline template library with pre-built wedding day schedules

## üß† SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP FOR COMPLEX FEATURE ANALYSIS

### When to Use Sequential Thinking

Before diving into coding, use Sequential Thinking MCP when facing:

- **Complex Feature Architecture**: Multi-component systems with intricate dependencies
- **Integration Challenges**: Features that span multiple systems and require coordination  
- **Business Logic Complexity**: Wedding-specific rules that need careful analysis
- **Technical Trade-offs**: Choosing between multiple implementation approaches
- **Debugging Complex Issues**: Root cause analysis for multi-system problems

### Sequential Thinking Patterns for Development Teams

#### Pattern 1: Feature Architecture Analysis
```typescript
// Before starting complex feature development
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This task tracking feature needs to integrate with existing task creation (WS-156), helper assignment (WS-157), and real-time notifications. Need to analyze data flow and identify potential integration points.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Data flow analysis: User creates task -> assigns helpers -> helpers update status -> triggers notifications -> updates progress indicators. Each step requires API endpoints, validation, and error handling.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

#### Pattern 2: Integration Strategy Planning  
```typescript
// When coordinating with other teams' work
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Team A is building UI components, Team C is handling real-time updates, and Team E is implementing testing. Need to define clear API contracts and data structures that all teams can use.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 3
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "API contract definition: /api/tasks/status endpoints need to support CRUD operations, validation schemas, and webhook events. Response format should match Team A's UI expectations.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 3
});
```

#### Pattern 3: Business Logic Analysis
```typescript
// When implementing wedding-specific business rules
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding task tracking has unique requirements: tasks can be delegated to multiple helpers, status updates need photo evidence for critical tasks, and deadlines are tied to wedding date proximity.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Business rule implementation: Critical tasks (venue confirmation, catering numbers) require photo evidence. Non-critical tasks (decoration pickup) can be marked complete without evidence. Need validation logic for each task type.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

### Using Sequential Thinking in Your Development Process

1. **Before Documentation Loading**: Use Sequential Thinking to understand the full scope and complexity
2. **During Planning Phase**: Structure your approach to handle all edge cases and integration points  
3. **When Stuck**: Use Sequential Thinking to work through complex problems systematically
4. **For Reviews**: Use Sequential Thinking to verify your implementation covers all requirements

**Remember**: Complex features require systematic thinking. Use Sequential Thinking MCP to ensure thorough analysis before implementation.

await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);
await mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed();

// 4. REVIEW existing patterns before creating new ones:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("TimelineBuilder", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("/src/components/timeline/");
```
