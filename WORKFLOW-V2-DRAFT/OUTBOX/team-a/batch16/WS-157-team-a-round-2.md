## ðŸŽ¯ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding couple delegating tasks to family and friends
**I want to:** Assign specific wedding tasks to helpers with clear instructions and timing
**So that:** Everyone knows their responsibilities and can execute tasks without confusion on the wedding day

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
A couple currently creates handwritten task lists like "Mom - handle gifts table" without clear timing or instructions. With this feature, they assign "Mary Johnson - Gift table setup (5:00pm-5:30pm) - Set up gift table in foyer, arrange card box, ensure gift security" with automatic notifications and check-in reminders.

## ðŸ“š STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

```typescript
// 1. LOAD CORRECT UI STYLE GUIDE:
await mcp__serena__read_file("/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// 2. CONTEXT7 MCP - Load latest docs:
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/vercel/next.js", "app-router server-actions", 5000);

await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/chartjs/chart.js", "react-integration", 2000);
await mcp__context7__get-library-docs("/react-dnd/react-dnd", "drag-drop patterns", 2000);

// 3. SERENA MCP - Initialize:
await mcp__serena__activate_project("/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync");
await mcp__serena__switch_modes(["editing", "interactive"]);

// 4. REVIEW existing Round 1 work:
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("HelperAssignment", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("/src/components/tasks");
```
