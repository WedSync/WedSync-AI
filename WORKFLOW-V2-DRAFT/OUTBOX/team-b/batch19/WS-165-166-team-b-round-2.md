# TEAM B - ROUND 2: WS-165/166 - Payment Calendar & Pricing Strategy System - Enhanced Backend & Performance Optimization

**Date:** 2025-08-25  
**Feature IDs:** WS-165, WS-166 (Combined batch development)
**Priority:** P1 from roadmap  
**Mission:** Enhance backend systems with advanced features, performance optimization, and team integrations
**Context:** You are Team B working in parallel with 4 other teams. Building on Round 1 foundations.

---

## üéØ ROUND 2 FOCUS: ENHANCEMENT & OPTIMIZATION

Building on Round 1's core backend infrastructure, now add:

**WS-165 - Payment Calendar Backend Enhancements:**
- Advanced query optimization and caching strategies
- Bulk payment operations and batch processing
- Integration with Team C's notification system APIs
- Performance monitoring and alerting systems
- Advanced RLS policies for complex access patterns

**WS-166 - Pricing Strategy Backend Enhancements:**
- Dynamic pricing engine with usage-based calculations
- Advanced subscription analytics and reporting APIs
- Integration with Team A's frontend pricing experiments
- Subscription lifecycle automation with business rules
- Multi-tenant feature access optimization

---

## üéØ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**WS-165 - Enhanced Payment Calendar Backend:**
**As a:** Wedding couple managing complex payment schedules
**I want to:** Backend system that handles bulk payment updates, recurring payments, and intelligent reminders
**So that:** I can efficiently manage 20+ payments across multiple vendors with automated cash flow optimization

**WS-166 - Enhanced Pricing Strategy Backend:**
**As a:** Wedding supplier with growing business
**I want to:** Backend system that automatically adjusts my subscription based on usage and provides detailed analytics
**So that:** I can optimize my costs and understand my feature usage patterns to make informed business decisions

**Real Wedding Problems Enhanced Solutions Solve:**
1. **Payment Calendar Performance**: A couple managing 25 vendor payments (¬£45k total) needs bulk operations: "Mark all photography payments as paid", "Extend all due dates by 1 week due to venue change".
2. **Dynamic Pricing Intelligence**: A wedding planner using 85% of Professional tier features gets automatic upgrade suggestion before hitting limits, preventing service disruption during peak season.

## üß† SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP FOR ADVANCED OPTIMIZATION

### Advanced Backend Architecture Analysis
```typescript
// Complex performance optimization planning
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Round 2 focuses on performance optimization and advanced features. For payment calendar: need to optimize queries for couples with 50+ payments, implement caching for dashboard aggregations, add bulk operations for efficiency. For subscription system: need dynamic pricing calculations, usage analytics aggregation, automated tier recommendations. Both systems need enhanced monitoring and alerting.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 6
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Performance bottlenecks to address: Payment queries by date range (add composite indexes), subscription feature checks (implement caching), analytics aggregations (use materialized views). Need Redis caching strategy: payment summaries (5min TTL), feature access (1hr TTL), usage analytics (daily refresh).",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
