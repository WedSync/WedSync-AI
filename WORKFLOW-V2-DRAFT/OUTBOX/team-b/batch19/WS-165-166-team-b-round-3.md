## 🧠 SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP FOR PRODUCTION PLANNING

### Production Readiness Assessment
```typescript
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Round 3 is about production hardening and enterprise features. Critical requirements: 99.9% uptime SLA, SOX compliance for financial data, GDPR compliance for user data, enterprise SSO integration, multi-region deployment. Payment system handles millions in wedding transactions - zero tolerance for data loss. Subscription system must handle enterprise contracts with custom pricing.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 8
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Production architecture decisions: Multi-region deployment (US-East, US-West, EU-West for GDPR), database clustering with read replicas, Redis cluster for caching, Load balancers with health checks, CDN for API responses. Backup strategy: Continuous WAL archiving, daily full backups, cross-region replication, automated recovery testing.",
