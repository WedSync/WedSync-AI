## üéØ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** WedSync executive monitoring business performance and investor reporting requirements
**I want to:** View comprehensive business metrics in real-time dashboard including MRR growth, churn analysis, viral coefficient tracking, customer acquisition costs, and business health indicators  
**So that:** I can make data-driven decisions during Q2 peak wedding season when supplier signups increase 300%, track the success of supplier acquisition campaigns with clear ROI metrics, identify growth opportunities as couple engagement rises 250%, and provide accurate financial reporting to investors with monthly recurring revenue trends

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
During Q2 peak season, WedSync executives needed to track business health as MRR grew from ¬£45K to ¬£67K month-over-month while churn decreased to 3.2% due to suppliers seeing value during busy season. The business metrics dashboard shows viral coefficient increased to 1.8 as satisfied suppliers refer colleagues, customer acquisition costs decreased 40% due to word-of-mouth referrals, providing clear ROI data for continued platform investment and informed decisions about scaling operations during wedding season peaks.

## üß† SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP FOR COMPLEX FEATURE ANALYSIS

### When to Use Sequential Thinking

Before diving into coding, use Sequential Thinking MCP when facing:

- **Complex Feature Architecture**: Multi-component systems with intricate dependencies
- **Integration Challenges**: Features that span multiple systems and require coordination  
- **Business Logic Complexity**: Wedding-specific rules that need careful analysis
- **Technical Trade-offs**: Choosing between multiple implementation approaches
- **Debugging Complex Issues**: Root cause analysis for multi-system problems

### Sequential Thinking Patterns for Development Teams

#### Pattern 1: Feature Architecture Analysis
```typescript
// Before starting complex feature development
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This task tracking feature needs to integrate with existing task creation (WS-156), helper assignment (WS-157), and real-time notifications. Need to analyze data flow and identify potential integration points.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Data flow analysis: User creates task -> assigns helpers -> helpers update status -> triggers notifications -> updates progress indicators. Each step requires API endpoints, validation, and error handling.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

#### Pattern 2: Integration Strategy Planning  
```typescript
// When coordinating with other teams' work
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Team A is building UI components, Team C is handling real-time updates, and Team E is implementing testing. Need to define clear API contracts and data structures that all teams can use.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 3
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "API contract definition: /api/tasks/status endpoints need to support CRUD operations, validation schemas, and webhook events. Response format should match Team A's UI expectations.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 3
});
```

#### Pattern 3: Business Logic Analysis
```typescript
// When implementing wedding-specific business rules
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding task tracking has unique requirements: tasks can be delegated to multiple helpers, status updates need photo evidence for critical tasks, and deadlines are tied to wedding date proximity.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Business rule implementation: Critical tasks (venue confirmation, catering numbers) require photo evidence. Non-critical tasks (decoration pickup) can be marked complete without evidence. Need validation logic for each task type.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

### Using Sequential Thinking in Your Development Process

1. **Before Documentation Loading**: Use Sequential Thinking to understand the full scope and complexity
2. **During Planning Phase**: Structure your approach to handle all edge cases and integration points  
3. **When Stuck**: Use Sequential Thinking to work through complex problems systematically
4. **For Reviews**: Use Sequential Thinking to verify your implementation covers all requirements

**Remember**: Complex features require systematic thinking. Use Sequential Thinking MCP to ensure thorough analysis before implementation.

---

## üîí SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### MANDATORY SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION FOR EXECUTIVE DASHBOARD

**EVERY dashboard component MUST use the security framework at `/src/lib/validation/` and `/src/lib/security/`:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS (MANDATORY PATTERN FOR EXECUTIVE DASHBOARDS):
import { withSecureExecutiveAccess } from '@/lib/validation/middleware';
import { businessMetricsSchema } from '@/lib/validation/schemas';

// Executive dashboard with proper financial data security
export const BusinessMetricsDashboard = withSecureExecutiveAccess(
  ['executive', 'finance'], // Required roles for business metrics access
  async (user: ExecutiveUser) => {
    // User is validated executive with financial data access
    // Dashboard implementation here
  }
);
```

### SECURITY CHECKLIST FOR EXECUTIVE DASHBOARD

Teams MUST implement ALL of these for EVERY dashboard component:

- [ ] **Executive Authentication**: Use existing middleware with executive/finance role validation
- [ ] **Financial Data Access Control**: MANDATORY role-based access for business metrics and financial reporting
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Dashboard API calls must respect executive tier rate limits - DO NOT bypass
- [ ] **CSRF Protection**: All executive forms use CSRF tokens - automatic via middleware
- [ ] **Data Sanitization**: All financial data display uses proper formatting - see `/src/lib/security/input-validation.ts`
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: All executive dashboard access logged - use existing audit framework
- [ ] **Session Security**: Executive sessions have proper timeout and security validation
- [ ] **Error Handling**: NEVER expose financial calculation details or sensitive business metrics in error messages
