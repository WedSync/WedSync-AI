## ðŸ’¾ ENHANCED DATABASE OPTIMIZATIONS

### Advanced Indexing and Performance:

```sql
-- Advanced Composite Indexes for Complex Queries
CREATE INDEX idx_helper_assignments_complex ON helper_assignments(wedding_id, scheduled_time, status) WHERE status != 'cancelled';
CREATE INDEX idx_expenses_analytics ON expenses(wedding_id, expense_date, budget_category_id) INCLUDE (amount);
CREATE INDEX idx_budget_categories_spending ON budget_categories(wedding_id, allocated_amount, spent_amount);

-- Materialized Views for Analytics
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW wedding_budget_analytics AS
SELECT 
    bc.wedding_id,
    bc.category_name,
    bc.allocated_amount,
    bc.spent_amount,
    COALESCE(SUM(e.amount), 0) as actual_expenses,
    (bc.spent_amount / NULLIF(bc.allocated_amount, 0) * 100) as usage_percentage
FROM budget_categories bc
LEFT JOIN expenses e ON bc.id = e.budget_category_id
GROUP BY bc.id, bc.wedding_id, bc.category_name, bc.allocated_amount, bc.spent_amount;

-- Refresh materialized view function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_budget_analytics()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW wedding_budget_analytics;
    RETURN NULL;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Triggers for automatic refresh
CREATE TRIGGER refresh_budget_on_expense_change
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON expenses
    FOR EACH STATEMENT
    EXECUTE FUNCTION refresh_budget_analytics();
```
