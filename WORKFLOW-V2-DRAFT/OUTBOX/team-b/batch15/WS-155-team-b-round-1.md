## ðŸŽ¯ USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding couple sending bulk communications
**I want to:** Reliably send personalized messages to guest segments with delivery confirmation
**So that:** I know my important wedding updates reached the right guests successfully

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Couples need confidence their critical updates (venue changes, menu info, RSVP deadlines) actually reached guests. Generic email blasts often fail or get ignored. This system ensures reliable delivery with tracking and personalization.
