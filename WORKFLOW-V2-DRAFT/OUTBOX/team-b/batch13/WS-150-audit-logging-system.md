# TEAM B - BATCH 13: WS-150 - Comprehensive Audit Logging System

## ASSIGNMENT DATE: 2025-01-20

### TEAM B RESPONSIBILITIES
**Focus Areas**: Core Audit Service, API Endpoints, Data Processing

#### TASKS ASSIGNED TO TEAM B:
1. **Core Audit Service** (`/src/lib/audit/audit-service.ts`)
   - Audit logging with automatic enrichment
   - Specialized logging methods (security, financial, data access)
   - Performance optimization for high-volume logging
   - Change tracking and diff calculation

2. **Audit API Endpoints** (`/src/app/api/audit/*`)
   - `/api/audit/logs` - Query and search functionality
   - `/api/audit/investigation/*` - Investigation tools
   - `/api/audit/compliance/*` - GDPR/PCI compliance reports
   - `/api/audit/monitoring/*` - Real-time monitoring

3. **Investigation and Analytics Engine**
   - User activity pattern analysis
   - Anomaly detection algorithms
   - Request tracing across services
   - Compliance report generation

#### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- High-performance logging (handle 1000+ events/sec)
- Query optimization for large datasets
- Proper error handling without breaking app flow
- Background processing for analytics
- Integration with external logging services

#### INTEGRATION POINTS:
- Supabase audit tables and partitions
- External services (DataDog, Elastic)
- WebSocket for real-time events
- Alert notification systems

#### ESTIMATED EFFORT: 20-22 hours
**Due Date**: End of sprint (2025-02-03)

### DEPENDENCIES:
- Team D provides optimized database schema
- Team C implements WebSocket event streaming
- Team E handles external service integrations

### SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- [ ] Core service handles 1000+ events/sec without performance impact
- [ ] API endpoints respond within 2 seconds for complex queries
- [ ] Investigation tools provide accurate pattern analysis
- [ ] Compliance reports meet regulatory requirements
- [ ] No audit logging failures affect application functionality

### NOTES:
This is **mission-critical infrastructure** - audit logs must NEVER be lost. Implement comprehensive error handling, fallback mechanisms, and ensure audit operations are atomic.
