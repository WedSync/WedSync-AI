# TEAM B - ROUND 3: WS-173 - Performance Optimization Targets - Production Deployment & Monitoring

**Date:** 2025-08-28  
**Feature ID:** WS-173 (Track all work with this ID)  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical for mobile usage)  
**Mission:** Deploy production-ready performance optimizations with comprehensive monitoring  
**Context:** You are Team B finalizing backend performance optimization. ALL teams must complete before next feature.

## 🎯 USER STORY & WEDDING CONTEXT (CRITICAL - THINK HARD)

**As a:** Wedding supplier using WedSync on mobile at venues  
**I want to:** Fast loading pages even on slow 3G connections  
**So that:** I can quickly access client information during time-sensitive wedding coordination  

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**  
Production performance must be reliable during peak wedding seasons. When 50+ suppliers are accessing the system simultaneously during wedding events, backend performance directly impacts wedding day success.

## 🎯 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FROM ROUNDS 1-2

**Build upon previous rounds:**
- Performance metrics tracker service (Round 1)
- Multi-tier caching system (Round 2)
- Advanced query optimization (Round 2)
- Cache warming strategies

**Round 3 Focus: Production deployment and comprehensive monitoring**

## 🎭 PRODUCTION PERFORMANCE TESTING

```javascript
// Production performance validation
test('Production performance targets validation', async () => {
  // Test production API performance
  const endpoints = [
    '/api/clients',
    '/api/guest-lists',
    '/api/journey-instances',
    '/api/supplier-schedules'
  ];
  
  for (const endpoint of endpoints) {
    const response = await fetch(`https://production.wedsync.app${endpoint}`, {
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${productionToken}` }
    });
    
    expect(response.headers.get('x-response-time')).toBeLessThan('200');
    expect(response.headers.get('x-cache')).toMatch(/(HIT|MISS)/);
  }
  
  // Test cache performance in production
  const cacheMetrics = await fetch('https://production.wedsync.app/api/performance/cache');
  const metrics = await cacheMetrics.json();
  
  expect(metrics.hitRatio).toBeGreaterThan(0.85);
  expect(metrics.l1ResponseTime).toBeLessThan(1);
  expect(metrics.l2ResponseTime).toBeLessThan(5);
});
```

## 📊 MONITORING & ALERTING SETUP

```typescript
// Production monitoring configuration
const monitoringConfig = {
  alerts: {
    apiLatency: {
      threshold: '200ms',
      frequency: '1min',
      channels: ['slack', 'email']
    },
    cacheHitRatio: {
      threshold: '80%',
      frequency: '5min',
      channels: ['slack']
    },
    databaseConnections: {
      threshold: '80%',
      frequency: '1min',
      channels: ['slack', 'pager']
    }
  },
  
  dashboards: {
    performance: ['api_latency', 'cache_metrics', 'db_performance'],
    capacity: ['connection_pools', 'memory_usage', 'cache_size'],
    business: ['active_users', 'api_calls_per_minute', 'feature_usage']
