## ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND - BLOCKS PRODUCTION

### üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Any Deployment)

#### Issue #1: Build Error - Supabase Import Failure
- **Severity:** CRITICAL - Application Won't Build
- **Category:** Build/Import Error
- **Browser:** All browsers affected
- **Device:** All devices affected
- **Description:** Next.js build fails due to incorrect Supabase import in monitoring API route
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Start development server (npm run dev)
  2. Navigate to any page
  3. Check Next.js dev overlay - build error appears
  4. Console shows: "Export supabase doesn't exist in target module"
- **Expected Result:** Application builds without errors
- **Actual Result:** Build fails with import error in `/src/app/api/monitoring/performance/route.ts`
- **Console Errors:** 
  ```
  Export supabase doesn't exist in target module
  ./src/app/api/monitoring/performance/route.ts (10:1)
  The export supabase was not found in module [project]/src/lib/database/supabase-admin.ts
  Did you mean to import supabaseAdmin?
  ```
- **Impact on Wedding Vendors:** Application cannot be built for production, completely blocks deployment
- **Suggested Priority:** IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED
- **Developer Assignment:** Senior Developer - import naming issue
- **Fix:** Change `import { supabase }` to `import { supabaseAdmin }` in the monitoring route

#### Issue #2: Next.js Dev Overlay Blocking User Interactions
- **Severity:** CRITICAL - UI Completely Unusable
- **Category:** UI/Interaction Blocking
- **Browser:** All browsers in development mode
- **Device:** All devices affected
- **Description:** Next.js dev overlay portal intercepts all click events, making buttons and links unclickable
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/
  2. Try to click "Get Started" button
  3. Click is blocked by `<nextjs-portal>` element
  4. No navigation occurs
- **Expected Result:** Buttons should be clickable and navigate to signup/login pages
- **Actual Result:** All button clicks are intercepted and fail
- **Impact on Wedding Vendors:** Complete inability to use the application - no user can sign up or login
- **Suggested Priority:** IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED
- **Developer Assignment:** Senior Developer - development environment configuration

#### Issue #3: Poor Performance - Wedding Day Standards Not Met
- **Severity:** CRITICAL - Violates Wedding Day Protocol
- **Category:** Performance/Wedding Day Reliability

  - FCP: 1852ms (NEEDS IMPROVEMENT - should be <1200ms)
  - TTFB: 1696ms (NEEDS IMPROVEMENT - should be <600ms)
- **Impact on Wedding Vendors:** Violates Saturday Wedding Day Protocol - app would be unusable during live weddings
- **Wedding Day Requirements:** Response time must be <500ms even on 3G
- **Suggested Priority:** CRITICAL - Must fix before any wedding vendor can use this
- **Developer Assignment:** Performance Team - Bundle optimization and server response optimization

## üí° IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### STOP ALL WORK - FIX THESE CRITICAL ISSUES FIRST:

1. **Fix Supabase Import Error** (Blocking build)
   - Change import in `/src/app/api/monitoring/performance/route.ts`
   - From: `import { supabase }`
   - To: `import { supabaseAdmin }`

2. **Fix Next.js Dev Overlay Blocking Interactions**
   - Configure dev environment to not block user interactions
   - May need to adjust Next.js config or disable dev overlay in testing

3. **Performance Optimization Emergency**
   - Identify why LCP is 10+ seconds
   - Optimize bundle size and server response times
   - Must meet wedding day <500ms requirement

4. **Add Missing PWA Icons**
   - Generate and place required icon files
   - Critical for mobile wedding vendor experience

### After Critical Fixes - Address High Priority:
- Fix CSP to allow Vercel analytics
- Debug API route 500 errors
- Update Next.js to latest version
