# TEAM COORDINATION - BATCH 18A - 2025-01-20

## 🎯 FEATURE: WS-047 - Review Collection System

**Business Context:** This is a CORE SAAS feature that helps wedding suppliers automatically collect reviews from happy couples to grow their business. This was previously rejected as "lead generation" but this is INCORRECT - it's about showcasing success stories to attract new couples, not capturing leads.

**Why This Feature Is Critical:**
- Core revenue driver for suppliers (67% more bookings from reviews)
- Helps suppliers build social proof and credibility
- Automates tedious manual review collection process
- Essential for supplier retention and SAAS growth
