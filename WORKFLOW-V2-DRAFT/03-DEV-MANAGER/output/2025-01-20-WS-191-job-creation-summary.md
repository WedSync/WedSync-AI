3. **Team C** provides storage integration for **Team B** backup orchestration
4. **Team D** builds on **Team A** components for mobile optimization
5. **Team E** tests all team implementations and documents complete system

### Integration Validation:
- Teams A & D coordinate on responsive design consistency
- Teams B & C coordinate on API contracts and provider abstractions
- Team E validates all team outputs meet specification requirements
- All teams must use identical TypeScript interfaces for data structures

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SUCCESS REQUIREMENTS

### Non-Negotiable Evidence Requirements:
1. **File Existence Proof**: `ls -la` output showing created files
2. **TypeScript Compilation**: `npm run typecheck` with no errors
3. **Test Suite Passing**: All tests passing with coverage requirements
4. **Security Validation**: All API routes using withSecureValidation middleware
5. **Navigation Integration**: UI features connected to parent navigation
