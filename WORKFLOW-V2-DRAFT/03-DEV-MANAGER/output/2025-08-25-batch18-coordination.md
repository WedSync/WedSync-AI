# TEAM COORDINATION - BATCH 18 - 2025-08-25

## BATCH 18 OVERVIEW
- **Features:** WS-162 (Helper Schedules), WS-163 (Budget Categories), WS-164 (Manual Budget Tracking)
- **Teams:** A, B, C, D, E (5 teams)
- **Rounds:** 3 rounds per feature
- **Total Prompts:** 45 (15 per feature)

## FEATURE SUMMARIES

### WS-162: Helper Schedules
**Purpose:** Personalized wedding day schedules for helpers (bridesmaids, groomsmen, family)
**Key Components:** Timeline view, task assignments, schedule acceptance, notifications

### WS-163: Budget Categories
**Purpose:** Wedding budget organization with custom categories and visual tracking
**Key Components:** Category management, allocation tracking, overspend warnings, charts

### WS-164: Manual Budget Tracking
**Purpose:** Expense tracking with receipts and payment management
**Key Components:** Expense entry, receipt upload, payment tracking, budget alerts

## ROUND SCHEDULE

### Round 1: Core Implementation
- All teams work in parallel on foundation
- Teams A-E complete core components
- Must complete before Round 2 starts

### Round 2: Enhancement & Polish
- Build on Round 1 foundation
- Add advanced features and integrations
- All teams must complete before Round 3

### Round 3: Final Integration
- Complete testing and optimization
- Production readiness validation
- Final integration between all components

## INTEGRATION POINTS BY FEATURE

### WS-162 (Helper Schedules) Dependencies:
- Team A provides UI components → Teams B, C, D use
- Team B provides API endpoints → Teams A, C, D, E consume
- Team C provides notifications → Teams A, D integrate
- Team D provides mobile optimization → Team A adopts
- Team E validates all components

### WS-163 (Budget Categories) Dependencies:
- Team A creates budget UI → Teams B, C, D integrate
- Team B creates database schema → All teams use
- Team C handles budget analytics → Team A displays
- Team D optimizes for mobile → Team A implements
- Team E tests budget calculations

### WS-164 (Manual Budget Tracking) Dependencies:
- Depends on WS-163 categories being complete
- Team A creates expense forms → Teams B, C process
- Team B handles receipt storage → Teams A, D access
- Team C manages alerts → Teams A, D display
- Team D enables offline tracking → Team B syncs
- Team E validates expense workflows

## POTENTIAL CONFLICTS & RESOLUTIONS

### File Conflicts:
- `/src/components/budget/`: Teams A & D both modify
  - Resolution: Team A does base components, Team D does mobile variants

### Database Migrations:
- Multiple teams create migrations
  - Resolution: All teams send to SQL Expert for coordination
  - Path: `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/INBOX/sql-expert/migration-request-WS-XXX.md`

### API Routes:
- `/api/budget/` and `/api/schedules/` namespaces
  - Resolution: Team B owns route creation, others consume

## BLOCKING DEPENDENCIES

### Critical Path Items:
1. **WS-162 Round 1:** Team B must complete database schema first
2. **WS-163 Round 1:** Core category structure blocks WS-164
3. **WS-164 Round 1:** Requires WS-163 categories to exist

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Teams can use mock data initially
- Focus on component structure before integration
- Parallel development with agreed interfaces

## TEAM SPECIALIZATIONS

### Team A - Frontend/UI
- React components, Tailwind styling
- User interfaces, form handling
- Chart visualizations (Recharts)

### Team B - Backend/Database
- API routes, database schemas
- Supabase functions, migrations
- Data validation, business logic

### Team C - Integration/Services
- Email/SMS notifications
- Real-time subscriptions
- Third-party service integration

### Team D - Mobile/PWA
- Mobile optimization, touch gestures
- Offline functionality, service workers
- PWA features, responsive design

### Team E - Testing/QA
- Unit tests, integration tests
- E2E testing with Playwright
- Performance validation, security testing

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Per Round Completion:
- Round 1: Core features working (60% functionality)
- Round 2: Enhanced features (85% functionality)
- Round 3: Production ready (100% functionality)

### Quality Gates:
- >80% test coverage required
- Zero TypeScript errors
- Performance: <2s page load
- Accessibility: >95 score
- Security: All validations in place

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

### Status Updates:
- Each team creates completion report after each round
- Path: `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/team-[x]/batch18/WS-XXX-team-[x]-round-[N]-complete.md`

### Blocker Reporting:
- Report blockers immediately in team output
- Include specific dependency needs
- Suggest mitigation approaches

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **NO FORBIDDEN FEATURES:** These features are all ALLOWED (wedding coordination, not sales)
2. **SECURITY FIRST:** All API routes must use validation middleware
3. **MOBILE FIRST:** All UIs must work on 375px viewport
4. **TEST FIRST:** Write tests before implementation
5. **PARALLEL WORK:** All teams work simultaneously, not sequentially
