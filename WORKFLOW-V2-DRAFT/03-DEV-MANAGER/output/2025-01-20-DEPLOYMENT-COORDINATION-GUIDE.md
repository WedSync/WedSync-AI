## ⚡ DAILY COORDINATION PROTOCOLS

### Morning Standup Template (15 minutes)
**Each team reports**:
1. **Yesterday's Completed Work**: Specific deliverables finished
2. **Today's Planned Work**: What you'll complete today
3. **Blocking Issues**: Dependencies waiting on other teams
4. **Help Needed**: Specific assistance required

### Dependency Resolution Process
**When Team X blocks Team Y**:
1. **Immediate Escalation**: Team Y reports blocker in Slack #dev-coordination
2. **30-Minute Rule**: Team X has 30 minutes to provide status update
3. **2-Hour Resolution**: Either deliver dependency or provide workaround
4. **Escalation Path**: Dev Manager → Senior Developer → CTO if unresolved

### Cross-Team Integration Points
**API Integration Checkpoints**:
- Team B completes API endpoint → Immediately notify Team A
- Team B provides OpenAPI spec → Teams A, C, D can begin integration
- Team C completes AI service → Team B can begin full implementation

**UI/Mobile Integration Checkpoints**:
- Team A completes component → Share with Team D for mobile adaptation
- Team A finalizes UI patterns → Team D implements mobile equivalents
- Team D completes PWA features → Team A validates desktop compatibility

## 🧪 EVIDENCE VALIDATION COORDINATION

### Mandatory Evidence Collection (Per Team, Per Feature)
**Before claiming ANY deliverable complete**:

#### File Existence Proof:
```bash
# Each team must run and provide output:
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/[your-team-area]/
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/[main-component-file].tsx | head -20
```

#### TypeScript Validation:
```bash
# Must pass without errors:
npm run typecheck
```

#### Test Validation:
```bash
# Must achieve >90% coverage:
npm test [your-feature-area]
npm run test:e2e [your-feature-area] # Teams with E2E tests
```

### Evidence Submission Process
1. **Create Evidence Package**: `EVIDENCE-PACKAGE-WS-XXX-TEAM-Y/`
2. **Include Screenshots**: UI teams provide visual evidence
3. **Include Test Results**: All teams provide test output
4. **Include Performance Metrics**: Backend/Integration teams provide benchmarks
5. **Submit for Review**: Upload to shared coordination folder

## 🌟 WEDDING INDUSTRY SUCCESS VALIDATION

### Real Supplier Scenario Testing (All Teams)
**Every team must validate their work against these real scenarios**:

#### Photography Studio "Capture Moments":
- **Peak Season**: June processing 15 weddings, 12,000 photos
- **AI Usage**: Photo tagging, client emails, social media posts
- **Cost Target**: £380/month → £95/month (75% reduction)
- **Quality Requirement**: Maintain photo tagging accuracy >95%

#### Venue "Elegant Gardens":
- **Peak Season**: 50 events in June, multiple daily events
- **AI Usage**: Event descriptions, client communications, timeline generation
- **Cost Target**: £400/month → £120/month (70% reduction)
- **Service Requirement**: Real-time event description generation

#### Wedding Planner "Perfect Day Planning":
- **Peak Season**: Coordinating 25 weddings simultaneously
- **AI Usage**: Timeline assistance, vendor coordination, client communications
- **Cost Target**: £200/month → £60/month (70% reduction)
- **Workflow Requirement**: Mobile access during venue visits and client meetings

### Validation Checkpoints
**Each team validates**:
- **Team A**: UI supports all 3 supplier types with appropriate workflows
- **Team B**: Backend scales to handle peak season load (1.6x multiplier)
- **Team C**: Integrations maintain service quality during provider switching
- **Team D**: Mobile interfaces work offline during venue visits
- **Team E**: Testing confirms all cost reduction and performance claims

## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION & CONTINGENCY PLANS

### High-Risk Dependencies
**Risk**: Team B backend APIs delay Team A frontend development
**Mitigation**: Team A implements mock APIs for parallel development
**Contingency**: Senior Developer provides emergency API stub implementations

**Risk**: Team C AI integrations fail during Team B implementation  
**Mitigation**: Team C provides fallback integration patterns
**Contingency**: Temporary use of existing AI service for continued development

**Risk**: Wedding season cost optimization claims cannot be validated
**Mitigation**: Team E creates mathematical models for validation
**Contingency**: Reduce cost reduction claims to provable levels (50% minimum)

### Quality Gates (Non-Negotiable)
**No team advances to Round 2 without**:
1. ✅ All Round 1 files exist and compile
2. ✅ All tests pass with >90% coverage
3. ✅ Evidence package submitted and verified
4. ✅ Wedding industry scenarios validated
5. ✅ Performance benchmarks met
