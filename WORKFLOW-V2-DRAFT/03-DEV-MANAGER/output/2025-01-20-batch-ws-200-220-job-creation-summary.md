## 🔒 SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION ACROSS ALL FEATURES

### 🚨 MANDATORY SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
Every API route in all 21 features MUST include:

```typescript
// MANDATORY SECURITY PATTERN (implemented in all prompts)
import { withSecureValidation } from '$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/validation/middleware';
import { z } from 'zod';
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth';
import { rateLimitService } from '$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/rate-limiter';

export const POST = withSecureValidation(
  yourSchema,
  async (request, validatedData) => {
    // All inputs validated with Zod
    // Authentication checked
    // Rate limiting applied
    // SQL injection prevented
    // XSS prevention active
  }
);
```

**Security Coverage Per Feature:**
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Authentication checks for protected routes
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS prevention with output sanitization
- CSRF protection (automatic with Next.js)
- Audit logging for critical operations

---

## 🧭 NAVIGATION INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

### ❌ ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ORPHANED FEATURES
Every UI feature across all 21 WS items MUST integrate with parent navigation:

**Dashboard Features Integration:**
```typescript
// File: $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx
{
  title: "API Versions",    // WS-200
  href: "/admin/api-versions",
  icon: Settings
},
{
  title: "Webhooks",        // WS-201
  href: "/integrations/webhooks", 
  icon: Webhook
}
// ... continuing for all 21 features
```

**Navigation Requirements:**
- Desktop navigation link added
- Mobile navigation support verified
- Navigation states (active/current) implemented
- Breadcrumbs updated appropriately
- Accessibility labels included

---

## 📈 ENHANCED DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### 🧠 MCP SERVER ORCHESTRATION
Every prompt includes coordinated usage of:

1. **Serena MCP** - Intelligent code analysis and semantic understanding
2. **Sequential Thinking MCP** - Complex problem breakdown and analysis
3. **Ref MCP** - Current documentation and best practices
4. **Supabase MCP** - Database operations and migrations
5. **Playwright MCP** - E2E testing and visual validation  
6. **Task Tracker MCP** - Progress tracking and dependency management

### 🎯 AGENT COORDINATION STRATEGY
Each team prompt launches 6+ specialized agents:

```typescript
// Standard agent launch pattern (implemented in all prompts)
1. task-tracker-coordinator - Task breakdown and dependency tracking
2. [technical-specialist] - Team-specific expertise (react-ui, database, etc.)  
3. security-compliance-officer - Security requirement validation
4. code-quality-guardian - Code standards and quality maintenance
5. test-automation-architect - Comprehensive testing strategy
6. documentation-chronicler - Evidence-based documentation
```

## 🏆 QUALITY ASSURANCE FRAMEWORK

### ✅ EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLETION CRITERIA

**MANDATORY for Every Feature Completion:**
1. **File Existence Proof** - `ls -la` commands showing created files
2. **TypeScript Compilation** - `npm run typecheck` with zero errors
3. **Test Validation** - All tests passing with appropriate coverage
4. **Real Code Snippets** - Actual code from implemented files
5. **Performance Benchmarks** - Meeting specified performance targets

**No Hallucination Policy:**
- Teams cannot claim completion without file proof
- Reports must include actual code from real files  
- Evidence package required for all deliverables
- Senior dev review mandatory before advancement

### 📊 TESTING REQUIREMENTS PER FEATURE
- **Unit Tests:** >90% code coverage
- **Integration Tests:** All database and API operations
- **E2E Tests:** Complete user workflows with Playwright
- **Performance Tests:** Sub-response-time requirements
- **Security Tests:** Comprehensive vulnerability coverage
