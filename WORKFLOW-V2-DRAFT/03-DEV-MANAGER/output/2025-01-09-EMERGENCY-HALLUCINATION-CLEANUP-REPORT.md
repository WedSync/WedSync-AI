- ‚úÖ **WS-302**: WedSync Supplier Platform - verified wedding industry context
- ‚úÖ **WS-317**: WedMe Couple Platform - verified legitimate user stories
- ‚úÖ **Existing Team Prompts**: All checked and confirmed non-contaminated

**Sample Verification Evidence:**
```
WS-302: "As a wedding photographer Sarah, I need a unified platform where I can access all my business tools in one place..."
WS-317: "As a couple planning their wedding who receives information from multiple vendors through different systems..."
```

#### B. Team Prompt Integrity Check
**EXISTING TEAM PROMPTS VERIFIED CLEAN:**
- ‚úÖ WS-300+ job folders contain legitimate 5-team prompt structure
- ‚úÖ Each team prompt includes proper wedding vendor context
- ‚úÖ Evidence of Reality requirements properly enforced
- ‚úÖ No fabricated feature references found

## üìä CONTAMINATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### What Was Contaminated:
- **Feature Designer Output**: 7 fabricated specifications removed
- **Development Pipeline**: Risk of contaminated team prompts prevented
- **Total Fabrication Rate**: 7 out of 29+ features (24% contamination in this batch)

### What Was Protected:
- **Legitimate Features**: All GREEN TICK features preserved and verified
- **Team Prompts**: All existing WS JOBS folders confirmed legitimate
- **Development Teams**: No teams were assigned fabricated work
- **Production Pipeline**: Zero contaminated code reached development

### Contamination Source Analysis:
- **Root Cause**: Feature Designer generated bulk features using generic templates
- **Templates Used**: Identical "Advanced Feature Implementation" headers found
- **Themes**: Environmental sustainability, AR/VR, advanced ML not in wedding specs
- **Detection Method**: Cross-reference with CORE-SPECIFICATIONS revealed no mappings
