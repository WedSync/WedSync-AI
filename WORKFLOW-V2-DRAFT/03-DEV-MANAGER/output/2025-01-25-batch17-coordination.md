## POTENTIAL CONFLICTS

### File System Conflicts:
- **Teams A & D:** Both working on timeline interfaces
  - **Resolution:** Team A handles desktop (`/src/components/timeline/`), Team D handles mobile (`/src/app/wedme/timeline/`)
- **Teams B & C:** Both accessing notification services
  - **Resolution:** Team B creates notification triggers, Team C handles notification delivery

### Database Schema Conflicts:
- **Timeline & Task Integration:** WS-159 and WS-160 both extend task system
  - **Mitigation:** Team B coordinates schema changes, all migrations go through SQL Expert
- **Supplier Data:** WS-160 and WS-161 both access supplier information  
  - **Mitigation:** Shared supplier data model, coordinated through Team B APIs

## BLOCKING DEPENDENCIES

### Round 1 → Round 2 Blockers:
- **Team A:** UI component library must be complete for Teams B,C,D API contract design
- **Team B:** Task tracking APIs must be stable for timeline event integration
- **Team C:** Real-time infrastructure must be working for timeline collaboration
- **Team D:** Mobile patterns established for timeline mobile interface
- **Team E:** Performance benchmarks set for timeline optimization targets

### Round 2 → Round 3 Blockers:
- **Team A:** Timeline UI components must be complete for supplier schedule integration  
- **Team B:** Master timeline APIs must be stable for supplier schedule generation
- **Team C:** Calendar integrations working for supplier schedule export
- **Team D:** Mobile timeline interface patterns established for supplier mobile
- **Team E:** Timeline performance validated for supplier schedule load

## RISK MITIGATION

### Technical Risks:
1. **Complex Drag-Drop Implementation (Team A Round 2)**
   - **Mitigation:** Start with basic drag-drop, expand functionality iteratively
   - **Fallback:** Click-based timeline editing if drag-drop issues arise

2. **Real-time Collaboration Complexity (Team C Round 2)**
   - **Mitigation:** Use proven Supabase Realtime patterns from existing features
   - **Fallback:** Polling-based updates if real-time issues occur

3. **Mobile Performance with Complex Timelines (Team D Round 2/3)**
   - **Mitigation:** Implement timeline virtualization for large timelines
   - **Fallback:** Simplified mobile timeline view for performance

### Integration Risks:
1. **Timeline-Task Data Consistency**
   - **Mitigation:** Shared data validation schemas, coordinated through Team B
   - **Monitoring:** Team E validates data integrity across all integrations

2. **Supplier Schedule Generation Performance**  
   - **Mitigation:** Background processing for bulk schedule generation
   - **Monitoring:** Team E performance testing with realistic data volumes
