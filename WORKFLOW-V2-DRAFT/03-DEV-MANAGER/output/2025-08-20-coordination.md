## POTENTIAL CONFLICTS & RESOLUTIONS

### File System Conflicts:
**Conflict:** Teams A & D both working in `/src/components/forms/`
**Resolution:** 
- Team A: `/src/components/forms/builder/` and `/src/components/marketing/`
- Team D: `/src/components/forms/wedding/` and `/src/components/photos/`

**Conflict:** Teams B & C both modifying API routes
**Resolution:**
- Team B: `/src/app/api/onboarding/` and `/src/app/api/tutorials/`
- Team C: `/src/app/api/clients/` and `/src/app/api/import/`

### Database Conflicts:
**Conflict:** Multiple teams creating migrations simultaneously
**Resolution:** Sequential migration numbering:
- Team B: migrations 016-017 (vendor profiles, tutorial system)
- Team C: migration 018 (tagging system)
- Team D: migration 019 (photo management, payment fields)

### API Endpoint Conflicts:
**Conflict:** Overlapping endpoint namespaces
**Resolution:** Clear namespace allocation:
- Team A: No backend APIs (frontend only)
- Team B: `/api/onboarding/*`, `/api/tutorials/*`, `/api/templates/*`
- Team C: `/api/clients/*`, `/api/import/*`, `/api/responses/*`
- Team D: `/api/wedding/*`, `/api/photos/*`, `/api/payments/*`
- Team E: `/api/tags/*`, `/api/analytics/*`

## BLOCKING DEPENDENCIES & MITIGATION

### Critical Blocking Dependencies:

#### Round 1 → Round 2:
- **Team A blocked by Team B**: Vendor selection UI requires Team B's API endpoints
  - **Mitigation:** Team B prioritizes API endpoint delivery in Round 1
  - **Fallback:** Team A uses mock data until APIs ready

- **Team E blocked by Team C**: Tagging system needs client data structure
  - **Mitigation:** Team C delivers client schema early in Round 1
  - **Fallback:** Team E designs flexible schema adapter

#### Round 2 → Round 3:
- **Team A blocked by Team B**: Tutorial UI requires tutorial engine APIs
  - **Mitigation:** Team B delivers API contracts before implementation
  - **Fallback:** Team A builds UI with mock tutorial data

- **Team D blocked by Team B**: Payment fields need form template integration
  - **Mitigation:** Team B provides payment field template schema
  - **Fallback:** Team D builds standalone payment components first

### Non-Blocking Dependencies:
- Team C's import enhancements don't block other teams
- Team D's photo management is largely independent
- Team E's integration testing happens after all deliverables complete

---

## CROSS-TEAM COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

### Required Communication Points:

#### Daily Standup Topics:
1. **API Contract Updates**: Teams B, C, D report API changes
2. **Integration Readiness**: Teams confirm dependency deliverables
3. **Blocking Issues**: Any team experiencing delays reports immediately
4. **Testing Conflicts**: Coordinate shared testing resources

#### Round Completion Reports:
Each team must deliver 3 reports at round completion:
1. **Overview Report**: Progress summary and deliverables status
2. **Dev Manager Feedback**: Issues and recommendations for next round
3. **Senior Dev Review Prompt**: Specific review requests with file paths

**CRITICAL REMINDER:** This is a parallel development workflow. ALL 5 teams work simultaneously within each round. NO team proceeds to the next round until ALL teams complete the current round and resolve any integration issues.

**SUCCESS DEPENDS ON:** Clear communication, dependency management, and maintaining the parallel workflow discipline throughout all 3 rounds.
