# 📋 EVIDENCE VALIDATION TEMPLATES - WS-238, WS-239, WS-240
## Bulletproof Development Verification System

### 🚨 CRITICAL: NO HALLUCINATIONS ALLOWED

**80% of Round 1 implementations in previous batches were hallucinated or broken!**

These templates ensure every team provides **REAL EVIDENCE** of working implementations before claiming completion.

---

## 🎯 UNIVERSAL EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

### Every Team Must Provide (No Exceptions):

#### 1. FILE EXISTENCE PROOF
```bash
# Run these commands and provide EXACT output:
echo "=== VERIFYING FILES EXIST ==="
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/[your-component-path]/
echo ""
echo "=== VERIFYING MAIN FILE CONTENT ==="
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/[your-main-file].tsx | head -20
echo ""
echo "=== FILE COUNT VERIFICATION ==="
find $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/[your-area]/ -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" | wc -l
```

#### 2. TYPESCRIPT COMPILATION PROOF
```bash
# Must show "No errors found" or equivalent:
echo "=== TYPESCRIPT VALIDATION ==="
npm run typecheck
echo "Exit code: $?"
```

#### 3. TEST EXECUTION PROOF
```bash
# Must show passing tests:
echo "=== TEST EXECUTION ==="
npm test [your-feature-area] --verbose
echo ""
echo "=== COVERAGE REPORT ==="
npm run test:coverage [your-feature-area]
```

## 🚨 EVIDENCE REVIEW PROCESS

### Submission Process:
1. **Create Evidence Package**: Use templates above exactly
2. **Self-Validation**: Check against validation checklist  
3. **Peer Review**: Have another team member review evidence
4. **Submit for Review**: Upload to shared evidence folder
5. **Address Feedback**: Fix any issues identified in review

### Review Criteria:
- **Authenticity**: All evidence must be from real, working implementations
- **Completeness**: All template sections must be filled out completely
- **Accuracy**: All claims must be backed by verifiable evidence
- **Wedding Context**: Must demonstrate real wedding industry application
- **Quality**: Must meet all performance and security requirements

### Rejection Reasons:
- **Fabricated Evidence**: Any fake or placeholder content results in immediate rejection
- **Missing Files**: Incomplete evidence packages are rejected
- **Failed Tests**: Any failing tests or compilation errors result in rejection
- **Poor Performance**: Missing performance targets results in rejection
- **Missing Wedding Context**: Generic implementations without wedding focus rejected

---

## 🏆 EVIDENCE APPROVAL PROCESS

### Approval Levels:
1. **Self-Approval**: Team validates their own evidence first
2. **Peer Review**: Another team member reviews and approves
3. **Development Manager Review**: Final validation of evidence quality
4. **Senior Developer Review**: Technical validation for complex implementations

### Approval Criteria:
- ✅ **Complete**: All evidence templates filled out completely
- ✅ **Authentic**: All evidence from real, working implementations  
- ✅ **Performant**: Meets all specified performance benchmarks
- ✅ **Secure**: Passes all security validation requirements
- ✅ **Wedding-Focused**: Demonstrates real wedding industry application
- ✅ **Quality**: Code quality meets professional standards

### Post-Approval:
- Evidence package archived for future reference
- Team cleared to proceed to next development round
- Implementation marked as verified and deployment-ready
- Success story documented for other teams to learn from
