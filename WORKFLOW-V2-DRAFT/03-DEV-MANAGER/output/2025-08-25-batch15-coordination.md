**Strategy:** All teams collaborate on SAME features in parallel

---

## ðŸ”„ ROUND SCHEDULE

### ROUND 1: Core Implementation (Start Immediately)
- **Duration:** All teams work in parallel
- **Completion:** ALL teams must complete before Round 2 begins
- **Focus:** Build foundational components for both features
- **Dependencies:** Teams work independently on core functionality

### ROUND 2: Enhancement & Integration  
- **Duration:** All teams work in parallel
- **Completion:** ALL teams must complete before Round 3 begins
- **Focus:** Integrate Round 1 outputs, add advanced features
- **Dependencies:** Teams integrate with each other's Round 1 outputs

### ROUND 3: Production Readiness & Final Integration
- **Duration:** All teams work in parallel  
- **Completion:** ALL teams must complete for batch completion
- **Focus:** End-to-end integration, production optimization
- **Dependencies:** Complete system integration across all teams

## ðŸ”— INTEGRATION POINTS

### WS-154 (Seating Arrangements) Integration:
- **Team A â†’ Team B:** Frontend interfaces with optimization APIs
- **Team B â†’ Team C:** Algorithm results validated by conflict detection
- **Team C â†’ Team A:** Real-time conflict warnings displayed in UI
- **Team C â†’ Team D:** Mobile conflict detection integration
- **Team E â†’ All:** Database foundation supporting all team requirements

### WS-155 (Guest Communications) Integration:
- **Team A â†’ Team B:** UI interfaces with messaging APIs
- **Team B â†’ Team C:** Message processing integrated with provider services
- **Team C â†’ Team A:** Delivery status updates displayed in UI
- **Team C â†’ Team D:** Mobile provider integration
- **Team E â†’ All:** Message storage supporting all team operations

### Cross-Feature Integration:
- **Seating â†’ Communications:** Guest segmentation from seating informs messaging groups
- **Communications â†’ Seating:** Message delivery status affects guest availability
- **Shared Guest Data:** Both features share guest relationships and preferences

---

## ðŸš¨ POTENTIAL CONFLICTS & RESOLUTIONS

### File Conflicts:
- **Guest Components:** Team A (seating UI) and Team A (messaging UI) both modify `/src/components/guests/`
- **Resolution:** Team A creates separate subdirectories: `/seating/` and `/communications/`

### Database Conflicts:
- **Guest Tables:** Both features extend guest-related database tables
- **Resolution:** Team E creates unified schema supporting both feature requirements
- **Migration Coordination:** Single comprehensive migration file for both features

### API Endpoint Conflicts:
- **Guest APIs:** Teams B may create overlapping guest-related endpoints
- **Resolution:** Team B creates unified guest API supporting both seating and messaging needs

---

## ðŸ“Š BLOCKING DEPENDENCIES

### Round 1 Dependencies:
- **Team C blocked until Team B completes APIs** (both features)
  - **Mitigation:** Team C uses mock data and API stubs initially
- **Team D blocked until Team A defines interfaces** (mobile requirements)
  - **Mitigation:** Team D works with wireframes and estimated interfaces

### Round 2 Dependencies:  
- **All teams require Team E database completion** from Round 1
  - **Mitigation:** SQL Expert applies migrations as soon as Team E provides them
- **Team integrations require Round 1 API contracts**
  - **Mitigation:** Teams define API contracts early in Round 1

### Round 3 Dependencies:
- **Complete integration requires all Round 2 outputs**
  - **Mitigation:** Teams conduct integration testing throughout Round 2

---

## ðŸ“ˆ SUCCESS METRICS

### Batch 15 Success Criteria:
- [ ] **30 team prompts completed** across both features
- [ ] **All integration points working** between teams and features  
- [ ] **Database foundation** supporting both seating and messaging at scale
- [ ] **Mobile platforms** fully integrated with both features
- [ ] **Production readiness** validated for both feature sets
- [ ] **Cross-feature workflows** (seating â†’ communications) functional

### Performance Targets:
- **Seating Optimization:** <3 seconds for 200+ guest weddings
- **Message Delivery:** <1 minute for 200+ recipient messages
- **Mobile Performance:** <2 seconds load time on 3G networks
- **Database Queries:** <100ms for all seating and messaging queries
