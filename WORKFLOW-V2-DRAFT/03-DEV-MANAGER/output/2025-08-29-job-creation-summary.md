## JOB FOLDER STRUCTURE CREATED

```
/OUTBOX/WS JOBS/
â””â”€â”€ WS-001 Client List Views/
    â”œâ”€â”€ team-a.md (Frontend/UI - 4 view types, virtual scrolling)
    â”œâ”€â”€ team-b.md (Backend/API - Secure endpoints, database schema)
    â”œâ”€â”€ team-c.md (Integration - Real-time updates, webhooks)
    â”œâ”€â”€ team-d.md (Performance - Mobile PWA, optimization)
    â””â”€â”€ team-e.md (QA/Testing - Comprehensive test suite, docs)
```

## TEAM COORDINATION APPROACH

### 5 Teams Working in Parallel on SAME Feature:
- **Team A**: Frontend components and UI implementation
- **Team B**: Backend APIs and database schema (creates migration files for SQL Expert)
- **Team C**: Integration layer with external services and real-time updates
- **Team D**: Performance optimization and mobile/PWA features  
- **Team E**: Quality assurance, testing, and documentation (owns all testing)

### Dependencies Mapped:
- Team B provides API contracts â†’ Team A (required for data fetching)
- Team A provides UI specifications â†’ Team E (required for testing)
- Team C provides integration points â†’ All teams (real-time features)
- Team D provides performance benchmarks â†’ Team E (performance testing)

---

## QUALITY ASSURANCE BUILT-IN

### Evidence Requirements (Non-Negotiable):
- **File Existence**: `ls -la` output proving files exist
- **TypeScript**: `npm run typecheck` showing no errors
- **Tests**: `npm test` showing all tests passing
- **Security**: All API routes must use `withSecureValidation` middleware

### Security Implementation:
- Every API route requires Zod validation
- Authentication checks on protected endpoints
- Rate limiting applied where appropriate
- Input sanitization with `secureStringSchema`
- No direct `request.json()` usage allowed

---

## NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDATIONS

### Option 1: Continue with Available Specifications
- Process WS-002 through WS-010 (9 more features available)
- All have complete technical specifications in INBOX
- Can immediately create job folders and team prompts

### Option 2: Wait for WS-184+ Specifications
- Request creation of technical specifications for WS-184 through WS-190
- These need to be placed in `/INBOX/dev-manager/` as `WS-XXX-[name]-technical.md`
- Then re-run job creation process

### Recommended Action:
Continue with available specifications (WS-002+) to maintain development momentum while higher-numbered specifications are being created.

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Prompt Template Compliance:
- âœ… All prompts include Evidence of Reality requirements
- âœ… Security validation mandatory for all API routes  
- âœ… Navigation integration requirements for UI components
- âœ… Untitled UI + Magic UI technology stack enforced
- âœ… Sequential Thinking MCP integration for complex planning
- âœ… Serena MCP + Ref MCP documentation loading
- âœ… Playwright MCP testing requirements
- âœ… Wedding industry context in every user story

### File Naming Convention:
- Job folders: `WS-XXX Feature Name`
- Team files: `team-a.md`, `team-b.md`, `team-c.md`, `team-d.md`, `team-e.md`
- Clear WS tracking throughout all deliverables

---

## BATCH PROCESSING STATUS

- **Current Batch**: 1 of 7 requested jobs completed  
- **Available for Next Batch**: WS-002 through WS-165 (139 specifications)
- **Processing Capacity**: Up to 10 jobs per batch recommended
- **Completion Rate**: 5 prompts per job = 50 total prompts for 10-job batch

---

**Dev Manager Status**: âœ… Job creation workflow functioning correctly  
**Next Phase**: Ready to process additional jobs or await WS-184+ specifications  
**Quality Gate**: All security, evidence, and documentation requirements enforced
