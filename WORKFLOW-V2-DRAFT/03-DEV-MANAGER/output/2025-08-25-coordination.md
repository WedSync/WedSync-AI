# TEAM COORDINATION - 2025-08-25

## BATCH 14 ASSIGNMENTS

### FEATURE: WS-153 - Photo Groups Management
**Status**: Round 1 prompts created ✅  
**Teams**: A, B, C, D, E (ALL working on same feature in parallel)  
**Priority**: P1 - Critical wedding coordination feature  

## ROUND SCHEDULE

### Round 1: Core Implementation (STARTED)
- **Team A**: UI Components & User Interface
  - PhotoGroupManager.tsx, PhotoGroupBuilder.tsx, GuestSelector.tsx
  - Drag-drop functionality, responsive design
  - Integration with WS-151 guest system

- **Team B**: Backend API & Business Logic  
  - API endpoints: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for photo groups
  - Guest assignment logic, conflict detection
  - Integration with existing guest management

- **Team C**: Database Schema & Integration
  - Migration files: photo_groups, photo_group_members tables
  - RLS policies, constraints, indexes
  - **CRITICAL**: Send migration request to SQL Expert

- **Team D**: WedMe Platform Integration
  - Mobile-optimized photo group interface
  - Touch-friendly interactions, offline preparation
  - WedMe navigation integration

- **Team E**: Comprehensive Testing & Validation
  - Unit tests (>90% coverage), integration tests
  - E2E workflows, performance benchmarks
  - Security and accessibility testing

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: ALL teams must complete Round 1 before ANY team starts Round 2

### Round 2: Enhancement & Polish (PENDING)
- Will be created after ALL teams complete Round 1
- Focus on integration, performance optimization, edge cases

### Round 3: Final Integration (PENDING)  
- Will be created after ALL teams complete Round 2
- Focus on final integration, production readiness

## INTEGRATION POINTS

### Critical Dependencies:
- **Team C → Team B**: Database schema MUST be complete before API testing
- **Team B → Team A**: API contracts needed for UI integration
- **Team A → Team D**: Core components needed for WedMe adaptation
- **ALL → Team E**: Components/APIs needed for comprehensive testing

### Coordination Requirements:
- **Team C**: MUST send migration request to SQL Expert immediately
- **Team A & D**: Coordinate on mobile component patterns
- **Team B & E**: Share API specifications for testing
- **All Teams**: Update feature-tracker.log when complete

## POTENTIAL CONFLICTS

### File Overlap Prevention:
- **Team A**: `/src/components/guests/Photo*` (new files)
- **Team B**: `/src/app/api/photo-groups/` (new directory)  
- **Team C**: `/supabase/migrations/` (new migration files)
- **Team D**: `/src/app/(wedme)/photo-groups/` (new directory)
- **Team E**: `/src/__tests__/` (new test files)

**✅ NO CONFLICTS**: Each team works on separate file paths

### Database Coordination:
- **Team C**: Creates migration files but DOES NOT apply them
- **SQL Expert**: Will handle migration application and conflicts
- **Teams A,B,D,E**: Wait for migration completion before database testing

## BLOCKING DEPENDENCIES

### Immediate Blockers:
- **Team B**: Blocked until Team C migration is applied by SQL Expert
- **Team A**: Can start immediately (UI-focused, mock data initially)  
- **Team D**: Can start immediately (adapts Team A components)
- **Team E**: Can start unit testing immediately

### Resolution Strategy:
- **Team B**: Use mock/temporary data structures until migration ready
- **Team E**: Focus on component testing first, API testing after migration
- **All Teams**: Parallel development minimizes blocking

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Quality Gates (ALL must pass):
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors across all teams
- [ ] >90% test coverage (Team E validation)
- [ ] All security requirements implemented (Team E validation)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness validated (Team D + Team E)
- [ ] Database migration applied successfully (SQL Expert + Team C)

### Integration Checkpoints:
1. **End of Round 1**: Basic feature working end-to-end
2. **End of Round 2**: Enhanced feature with edge cases handled
3. **End of Round 3**: Production-ready feature with full integration

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

### Status Updates:
- **Teams**: Update `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/00-STATUS/feature-tracker.log` on completion
- **Format**: `DATE TIME | WS-153 | ROUND_N_COMPLETE | team-x | batch14`

### Issue Escalation:
- **Blocking Issues**: Report immediately in team completion report
- **Technical Conflicts**: Coordinate directly between affected teams
- **Critical Failures**: Escalate to Senior Developer review

### Completion Reports:
- **Location**: `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/team-{x}/batch14/WS-153-team-{x}-round-1-complete.md`
- **Required**: Technical deliverables, evidence package, dependencies met
- **Include**: Any issues encountered, recommendations for next round

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Teams A, B, C, D, E**: Execute Round 1 prompts immediately
2. **Team C**: Send migration request to SQL Expert ASAP  
3. **All Teams**: Create completion reports when finished
4. **Dev Manager**: Monitor progress, create Round 2 prompts after ALL complete
5. **Senior Developer**: Review Round 1 outputs before Round 2 begins

---

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
- This is a P1 feature - wedding coordination is core business value
- ALL teams work on SAME feature - true parallel development  
- Round 2 cannot start until ALL teams complete Round 1
- Quality over speed - proper implementation prevents technical debt
