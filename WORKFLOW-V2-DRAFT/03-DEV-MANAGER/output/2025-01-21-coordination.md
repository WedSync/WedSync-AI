## CRITICAL INTEGRATION POINTS

### End of Round 1
- **Team A → Team B**: Dashboard layout available for timeline integration
- **Team C → All Teams**: Security foundation (authentication, encryption) available
- **Team E → All Teams**: Notification infrastructure operational
- **Team B → Team A**: Timeline optimization API available for UI

### End of Round 2
- **Team A → Team D**: Real-time infrastructure for analytics
- **Team B → Team B Round 3**: ML models ready for task automation
- **Team C → All Teams**: Compliance framework implemented
- **Team D → Team A Round 3**: Reporting engine for analytics dashboard
- **Team E → Team D**: Vendor data for financial reporting

### End of Round 3
- **All Teams Integration Test**: Full system integration testing
- **Team C**: Performance optimization affects all features
- **Team B**: Task automation integrates with all workflows
- **Team D**: CRM integrates with all customer touchpoints

---

## POTENTIAL CONFLICTS & RESOLUTIONS

### File Conflicts
- **Teams A & D**: Both may touch `/wedsync/src/components/dashboard/`
  - **Resolution**: Team A owns base dashboard components, Team D extends for analytics widgets

- **Teams B & E**: Both may modify `/wedsync/src/lib/notifications/`
  - **Resolution**: Team E owns notification core, Team B only adds timeline-specific notifications

- **Teams C & All**: Security middleware affects all API routes
  - **Resolution**: Team C provides security wrapper components, other teams use but don't modify

### Database Conflicts
- **Multiple teams creating migrations**
  - **Resolution**: Sequential migration numbering coordinated through Slack
  - **Convention**: Use prefix: team-a-XXX, team-b-XXX, etc.

---

## BLOCKING DEPENDENCIES

### Critical Path Items (Must Complete First)
1. **Team C Round 1**: Security foundation - ALL teams need authentication
2. **Team B Round 1**: Timeline optimization - Core business logic (P0)
3. **Team E Round 1**: Notification system - Required by 4 other teams

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Team A**: Can use mock authentication initially, integrate Team C's work in Round 2
- **Team D**: Can build billing logic with mock security, integrate in Round 2
- **Team B Round 3**: Depends on Round 1&2 timeline work - no mitigation possible

---

## UI LIBRARY COMPLIANCE

### CRITICAL REMINDER
- **General UI**: Untitled UI + Magic UI ONLY
- **NO Radix UI, NO shadcn/ui, NO Catalyst UI**
- **Journey Builder**: XYFlow/React Flow (only for WS-013 journey features)
- **Style Guides**: 
  - `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md` - General UI
  - `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/JOURNEY-BUILDER-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md` - Journey features only

---

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

### Daily Sync Points
- **09:00 AM**: Team leads brief status in #dev-standup
- **02:00 PM**: Integration point check-in
- **05:00 PM**: End-of-day progress report

### Escalation Path
1. Team member → Team Lead
2. Team Lead → Dev Manager
3. Dev Manager → Senior Dev (for technical review)
4. Senior Dev → Project Orchestrator (for priority conflicts)

### Documentation Requirements
- Each team outputs to: `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/team-[x]/`
- Use standard team output template
- Include WS-XXX ID in all filenames
- Run `./route-messages.sh` after completion

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Round Completion Criteria
- All deliverables complete with evidence
- Tests written and passing (>80% coverage)
- Playwright tests validating user flows
- Zero TypeScript errors
- Performance targets met
- Security requirements validated

### Quality Gates
- Code review by Senior Dev before Round progression
- Integration tests between dependent teams
- Performance benchmarks must pass
- Security scan must pass

---

## RISK MANAGEMENT

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Team B Timeline Optimization**: Complex algorithm, many dependencies
2. **Team C Security**: Foundation for all features, cannot fail
3. **Team A/D Analytics Integration**: Complex data flows

### Contingency Plans
- **If Team B delayed**: Other teams continue with mock timeline data
- **If Team C delayed**: STOP all work until security complete (P0)
- **If integration fails**: Dedicated integration sprint before Round 3

---

## NOTES FOR SENIOR DEV REVIEW

### Priority Review Areas
1. **Security implementation** (Team C) - Any vulnerabilities affect entire system
2. **Timeline optimization algorithm** (Team B) - Core business logic must be correct
3. **Payment processing** (Team D) - Financial data handling critical
4. **Real-time infrastructure** (Team A) - Foundation for many features

### Expected Challenges
- WebSocket implementation complexity (Team A Round 2)
- ML model training data requirements (Team B Round 2)
- Multi-provider payment gateway complexity (Team D Round 1)
- OCR accuracy requirements (Team E Round 3)
