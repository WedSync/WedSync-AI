- Round 2: WS-022 (SMS Configuration) - Twilio integration
- Round 3: WS-027 (Message History) - Communication audit trail

### Team C - Integration & Real-time
- Round 1: WS-018 (Wedding Day Module) - Real-time coordination hub
- Round 2: WS-023 (WhatsApp Setup) - WhatsApp Business API
- Round 3: WS-028 (A/B Testing) - Journey optimization

### Team D - External Services
- Round 1: WS-019 (Travel Time Calculator) - Google Maps integration
- Round 2: WS-024 (Calendar Integration) - Multi-provider calendar sync
- Round 3: WS-029 (Journey Templates) - Pre-built workflows

### Team E - Core Systems
- Round 1: WS-020 (Weather Integration) - OpenWeatherMap API
- Round 2: WS-025 (Meeting Scheduler) - For EXISTING clients only
- Round 3: WS-030 (Journey Execution Engine) - Workflow automation

## INTEGRATION POINTS

### Critical Dependencies - Round 1
- Team C (WS-018) provides real-time infrastructure for others
- Team B (WS-017) provides analytics foundation

### Critical Dependencies - Round 2
- Team D (WS-024) calendar system needed by Team E (WS-025)
- Team B (WS-022) SMS config needed by Team C (WS-023)

### Critical Dependencies - Round 3
- Team E (WS-030) integrates all previous work
- Team A (WS-026) uses all communication channels
- Team B (WS-027) logs all communications

## POTENTIAL CONFLICTS

### File/Directory Conflicts
- `/wedsync/src/components/` - Multiple teams adding components
  - Resolution: Each team uses feature-specific subdirectories
- `/wedsync/src/app/api/` - Multiple API routes being added
  - Resolution: Each team uses feature-named route folders
- `/wedsync/supabase/migrations/` - Multiple migrations
  - Resolution: Sequential numbering coordinated via Slack

### Resource Conflicts
- Supabase Realtime channels - Teams B, C, E
  - Resolution: Namespace channels by feature (analytics:*, wedding-day:*, etc.)
- Google Maps API - Teams C, D
  - Resolution: Share API key, coordinate rate limits

## BLOCKING DEPENDENCIES

### Round 1 → Round 2
- None identified - all can proceed independently

### Round 2 → Round 3
- Team D must complete WS-024 (Calendar) before Team E starts WS-030
- Team B must complete WS-022 (SMS) before Team A starts WS-026

### Mitigation Strategy
- Teams with dependencies should share interfaces early
- Use mock services initially if blocked

## QUALITY GATES

### Round 1 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Core functionality implemented
- [ ] Basic tests passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful
- [ ] Playwright tests for happy path

### Round 2 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Enhanced features with error handling
- [ ] Performance optimization complete
- [ ] Integration with dependent features
- [ ] Expanded Playwright test coverage

### Round 3 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Full integration tested
- [ ] All Playwright tests passing
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Production ready

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

### Daily Sync Points
- Round start: Teams read prompts from their OUTBOX
- Mid-round: Optional Slack check-in for blockers
- Round end: Teams output completion reports to OUTBOX

### Escalation Path
1. Team encounters blocker → Post in Slack #batch2-blockers
2. If unresolved in 30 min → Escalate to Senior Dev
3. If still blocked → Dev Manager adjusts allocation

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Technical Metrics
- All 15 features implemented and tested
- Zero TypeScript errors across all features
- All Playwright tests passing
- <2 second load times for all UIs
- <200ms API response times

### Business Metrics
- Wedding coordination features complete
- Communication channels integrated
- Real-time capabilities functional
- Mobile experience optimized
- Analytics and tracking operational

## NOTES FOR SENIOR DEV REVIEW

### High Priority Reviews
1. **WS-025 (Meeting Scheduler)** - Ensure it's for EXISTING clients only
2. **WS-018 (Wedding Day Module)** - Critical real-time infrastructure
3. **WS-030 (Journey Engine)** - Core automation system

### Security Considerations
- WS-016 (Notes) - Private notes must have proper RLS
- WS-026 (Bulk Messaging) - Rate limiting critical
- WS-023 (WhatsApp) - API key security

### Performance Focus
- WS-017 (Analytics) - Materialized views optimization
- WS-019 (Travel Time) - Cache Google Maps responses
- WS-030 (Journey Engine) - Queue management for scale
