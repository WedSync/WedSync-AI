- **Backend Only:** Wedding suppliers never see device management or sensor monitoring
- **Technical Value:** Venue infrastructure improvement, not wedding coordination

---

## üö® WEDDING FOCUS ENFORCEMENT

**WedSync Development Manager Ruling:**
WS-275 represents the **fifth consecutive "wedding-washing"** attempt - taking a pure IoT management platform and adding wedding venue applications without changing the core platform functionality.

**The Reality:**
- Core deliverables are IoT infrastructure development
- Target users are IoT specialists and facility managers
- Wedding suppliers never interact with IoT platform features
- This is smart building technology, not wedding coordination

---

## üéØ APPROVED ALTERNATIVES FOR WEDDING COORDINATION

Instead of IoT device management, wedding-focused venue features should include:

### ‚úÖ **WEDDING-SPECIFIC VENUE FEATURES:**
1. **Venue Ambiance Presets** - Pre-configured lighting and sound settings for different wedding moments
2. **Environmental Comfort Dashboard** - Simple venue condition monitoring for wedding coordinators
3. **Venue Setup Checklists** - Digital checklists for venue preparation and equipment verification
4. **Wedding Day Environment Alerts** - Simple notifications for temperature, lighting, or sound issues
5. **Venue Coordination Hub** - Communication center for venue staff during wedding events

---

## üìù RECOMMENDATION

**ACTION**: REJECT WS-275 IoT Device Management System

**RATIONALE**:
- Pure IoT platform disguised with wedding venue applications
- Zero direct interaction from wedding suppliers in their coordination workflow
- Belongs in smart building technology, not wedding feature development
- Would consume wedding development resources without adding wedding-specific user value

**CRITICAL ESCALATION**:
**5/5 consecutive platform features rejected** - systematic misclassification requires immediate review of remaining features and feature generation process.

---

## üö® EMERGENCY DEVELOPMENT MANAGER DIRECTIVE

**CRITICAL PATTERN ALERT:**
100% of validated features have been technical platforms, not wedding coordination features. This suggests:

1. **Systematic Misclassification**: Feature generation process is creating platform features instead of wedding features
2. **Resource Waste Risk**: Development teams would build technical platforms instead of wedding tools
3. **Product Vision Drift**: Platform focus instead of wedding supplier focus
4. **Immediate Course Correction Required**: Remaining features must be rapidly validated and likely rejected

**NEXT STEPS**:
1. **RAPID VALIDATION** of remaining 3 features (WS-277, WS-278, WS-279) expected to be platform features
2. **ESCALATE to Product Management** - Feature generation process needs immediate review
3. **REFOCUS on Wedding Coordination** - Generate genuine wedding supplier workflow features
4. **PROTECT Development Resources** - Prevent platform development consuming wedding development capacity

## üö® DEVELOPMENT MANAGER WARNING

**To All Teams**: This rejection confirms systematic platform washing:
- **Wedding Coordination ONLY** - Features must be directly used by wedding suppliers
- **NO TECHNICAL PLATFORMS** - IoT, blockchain, quantum, CDN, infrastructure are not wedding features
- **USER JOURNEY FOCUS** - Wedding vendors must interact with features directly in their daily workflow
- **SUPPLIER VALUE FIRST** - Features must solve actual wedding coordination problems

**WedSync is a WEDDING COORDINATION PLATFORM, not a smart building management system.**

---

**Status**: Feature definitively rejected - no team prompts created  
**Impact**: CRITICAL - 5/5 platform features rejected requiring immediate escalation  
**Next Action**: Rapid validation of remaining features expected to continue rejection pattern  
**Alert Level**: MAXIMUM - Systematic platform washing confirmed
