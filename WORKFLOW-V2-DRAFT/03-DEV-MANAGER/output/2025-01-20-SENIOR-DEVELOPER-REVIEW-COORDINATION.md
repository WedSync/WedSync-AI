## 🔄 REVIEW ORCHESTRATION MATRIX

### Sequential Review Batching Strategy

#### Batch 1: Core Architecture Reviews (Days 1-3)
**Review Order Priority**:
1. **WS-238 Team B** (Knowledge Base Backend) - Foundation for all other teams
2. **WS-239 Team B** (Dual AI Backend) - Critical architecture decisions  
3. **WS-240 Team B** (Cost Optimization Backend) - Algorithm validation
4. **WS-238 Team C** (AI Integrations) - Service layer dependencies
5. **WS-239 Team C** (Provider Integrations) - Multi-provider architecture

**Rationale**: Backend and integration reviews first ensure solid foundation before frontend/mobile work.

#### Batch 2: User Experience Reviews (Days 4-5)
**Review Order Priority**:
