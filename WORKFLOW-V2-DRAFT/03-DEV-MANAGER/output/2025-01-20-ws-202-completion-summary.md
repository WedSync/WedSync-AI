## 🔒 SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION ACROSS REALTIME FEATURES

### 🚨 MANDATORY REALTIME SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
Every realtime endpoint and connection in WS-202 MUST include:

```typescript
// MANDATORY SECURITY PATTERN (implemented in all prompts)
import { withSecureValidation } from '$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/validation/middleware';
import { z } from 'zod';
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth';
import { rateLimitService } from '$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/rate-limiter';

export const POST = withSecureValidation(
  realtimeSubscriptionSchema,
  async (request, validatedData) => {
    // Connection authentication checked
    // User permissions validated for channels
    // Rate limiting applied for connections
    // Audit logging for realtime activities
    // Data sanitization for realtime updates
  }
);
```

**Security Coverage Per Realtime Feature:**
- Connection authentication and user validation
