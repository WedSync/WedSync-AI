## INTEGRATION DEPENDENCIES

### Critical Handoffs

#### End of Round 1:
- Team A → Team D: Component APIs for mobile variants
- Team B → Team C: API endpoints for edge deployment
- Team C → Team D: Service Worker for offline support

#### End of Round 2:
- Team B → Team A: Performance metrics API
- Team C → All Teams: CDN configuration complete

- Team E → DevOps: Performance and security reports

---

## POTENTIAL CONFLICTS & RESOLUTIONS

### File Conflicts:
1. **next.config.ts**: Teams A, C modify
   - Resolution: Team C owns webpack config, Team A owns image config
   
2. **/src/middleware.ts**: Teams B, C modify for security
   - Resolution: Team B implements, Team C reviews

3. **/src/lib/auth/**: Teams A, B, D access
   - Resolution: Team B owns core, others extend

### Resource Conflicts:
- Database migrations: All go through SQL Expert
- Redis configuration: Team B owns, Team C consumes
- Service Worker: Team C implements, Team D extends

---

## BLOCKING DEPENDENCIES & MITIGATIONS

### Round 1 Blockers:
- **None identified** - All teams can work independently

### Round 2 Blockers:
- Team A needs Team B's metrics API
  - Mitigation: Use mock data initially
- Team D needs Team C's Service Worker
  - Mitigation: Create interface contract first

### Round 3 Blockers:
- All teams need Team E's test validation
  - Mitigation: Run tests continuously, not just at end

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Performance (WS-173):
- ✅ FCP < 2.5s on 3G
- ✅ LCP < 4s on 3G
- ✅ API response < 200ms p99
- ✅ Bundle size < 250KB initial

### Security (WS-174):
- ✅ MFA enabled and working
- ✅ Session hijacking prevented
- ✅ Password policies enforced
- ✅ Failed login rate limiting active

### Encryption (WS-175):
- ✅ All PII fields encrypted
- ✅ Key rotation automated
- ✅ GDPR compliance validated
- ✅ Performance impact < 10ms

## RISK MANAGEMENT

### High Risks:
1. **Performance regression from encryption**
   - Monitor continuously with Team E's tools
   - Optimize encryption algorithms if needed

2. **MFA breaking existing auth flows**
   - Implement behind feature flag initially
   - Gradual rollout with monitoring

3. **Bundle size exceeding targets**
   - Team C monitors continuously
   - Aggressive code splitting if needed

### Medium Risks:
1. **Mobile battery drain from optimizations**
   - Team D monitors battery usage
   - Adjust animation/polling frequencies

2. **Cache invalidation complexity**
   - Team B implements careful cache keys
   - Team C provides invalidation webhooks

---

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

### Daily Sync Points:
- Morning: Teams report blockers in Slack
- Midday: Integration point validation
- Evening: Progress update to Dev Manager

### Escalation Path:
1. Team blocker → Team Lead
2. Cross-team blocker → Dev Manager
3. Technical blocker → Senior Dev
4. Security issue → Security Officer

---

## SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS

### Database Migrations:
- All teams create migration files but DO NOT apply
- Send to SQL Expert via /INBOX/sql-expert/
- Include dependencies and testing status

### Security Considerations:
- All API routes MUST use security middleware
- No console.log in production code
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
- Follow OWASP best practices

### Performance Testing:
- Run Lighthouse after each component change
- Load test APIs with 100+ concurrent users
- Monitor Core Web Vitals continuously
- Alert on any regression >10%
