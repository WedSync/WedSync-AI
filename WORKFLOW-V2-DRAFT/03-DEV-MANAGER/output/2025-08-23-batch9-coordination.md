## CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES

### üö® Blocking Dependencies (Must be resolved for progress)

#### Team A Dependencies:
- **FROM Team B:** Profile creation API endpoints - **CRITICAL for Round 2**
  - Required: POST /api/suppliers/profiles/create
  - Required: PATCH /api/suppliers/profiles/{id} 
  - Required: POST /api/suppliers/profiles/{id}/upload
- **FROM Team D:** Test utilities for file upload - **NEEDED for Round 1**
  - Required: Mock file upload functions
  - Required: Component testing helpers

#### Team B Dependencies:
- **FROM Team D:** API testing framework - **CRITICAL for Round 1**
  - Required: API endpoint mocking utilities
  - Required: Stripe webhook testing setup

#### Team C Dependencies:
- **FROM Team B:** Database migration completion - **BLOCKING Round 1**
  - Required: field_mappings table schema
  - Required: core_field_definitions table

#### Team D Dependencies:
- **FROM Team A:** Component interfaces - **NEEDED for Round 1**
  - Required: Props definitions for wizard components
  - Required: Form validation schemas

#### Team E Dependencies:
- **FROM Team D:** Test PDF fixtures - **NEEDED for Round 1**
  - Required: Sample wedding vendor PDFs
  - Required: Expected extraction results
- **TO Team C:** Extracted fields - **CRITICAL for Round 2**
  - Required: Field labels and types
  - Required: Page context information

### üîó Non-Blocking Dependencies (Enhance functionality)
- Team A ‚Üê Team C: Service category auto-suggestions (enhances UX)
- Team B ‚Üê Team C: Real-time mapping integration (future feature)
- Team C ‚Üê Team A: Field mapping UI feedback (improves accuracy)

## POTENTIAL CONFLICTS

### ‚ö†Ô∏è File Modification Conflicts
- **Risk:** Teams A & D both modifying `/src/types/suppliers.ts`
- **Resolution:** Team A owns supplier types, Team D extends for testing
- **Mitigation:** Team D creates separate test-specific type extensions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Database Migration Conflicts
- **Risk:** Teams B & C creating conflicting table schemas
- **Resolution:** All migrations routed through SQL Expert for conflict resolution
- **Mitigation:** Teams create migration request files, do not apply directly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è API Endpoint Conflicts
- **Risk:** Team A & B conflicting on API response formats
- **Resolution:** Team B defines API contract first, Team A implements accordingly
- **Mitigation:** API specification sharing in Round 1

## BLOCKING SCENARIOS & RESOLUTIONS

### üö´ Scenario 1: Team B API Delays Block Team A Upload Feature
**Problem:** Team B's file upload APIs not ready by Round 2
**Impact:** Team A cannot complete portfolio upload step
**Resolution:** 
- Team A implements with mock APIs from Team D
- Team B provides API specifications early in Round 1
- Integration testing in Round 3 validates real API functionality

### üö´ Scenario 2: Team C OpenAI Integration Affects Team D Testing
**Problem:** OpenAI API calls consume rate limits during testing
**Impact:** Team C integration tests fail due to quota exhaustion
**Resolution:**
- Team D provides OpenAI mocking utilities in Round 1
- Team C uses mocks for development, real API for final validation
- Rate limiting configuration prevents quota exhaustion

### üö´ Scenario 3: Team D Testing Infrastructure Delays All Teams
**Problem:** Test utilities not ready, blocking other teams' testing
**Impact:** All teams cannot write comprehensive tests
**Resolution:**
- Team D prioritizes basic test utilities in Round 1
- Teams can start with minimal testing, enhance in Round 2
- Advanced testing features delivered in Round 2

## SUCCESS METRICS

### üìä Round 1 Success Criteria
- Team A: Basic wizard flow working (4 steps navigable)
- Team B: Core MRR calculation APIs functional (3 endpoints)
- Team C: Basic mapping algorithms implemented (80% accuracy)
- Team D: Test infrastructure configured (Vitest working, 60% coverage)

### üìä Round 2 Success Criteria  
- Team A: File upload working with optimization
- Team B: Stripe integration processing webhooks
- Team C: AI integration working with OpenAI APIs
- Team D: Comprehensive mocking utilities for all services

### üìä Round 3 Success Criteria
- Team A: Complete wizard production-ready (Lighthouse 90+)
- Team B: MRR dashboard with real-time updates
- Team C: Smart mapping with conflict resolution
- Team D: 80%+ test coverage across all features

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

### üì¢ Daily Standups (Async)
- Each team posts progress in team-specific batch9 folders
- Blockers escalated to dev-manager immediately
- Integration points confirmed at end of each round

### üö® Escalation Process
1. **Team-Level Issue:** Team attempts resolution for 2 hours max
2. **Cross-Team Dependency:** Immediate coordination via shared documents
3. **Technical Blocker:** Escalation to Senior Developer within 4 hours
4. **Critical Production Issue:** Immediate escalation to all stakeholders

### üìã Deliverable Tracking
- All teams use WS-XXX naming in commits and files
- Evidence packages required for round completion
- Integration testing mandatory before next round starts

## RISK MITIGATION

### üõ°Ô∏è High-Risk Areas
1. **File Upload Security (Team A):** Malicious file prevention, encryption
2. **Financial Data Accuracy (Team B):** MRR calculations must be mathematically perfect
3. **AI API Reliability (Team C):** OpenAI service failures require graceful fallbacks
4. **Test Coverage Gaps (Team D):** Missing edge cases could allow production bugs

### üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies
- Security reviews mandatory for all file handling code
- Financial calculations validated with known test datasets
- AI services implement comprehensive error handling and retries
- Test coverage thresholds enforced (80% minimum)
