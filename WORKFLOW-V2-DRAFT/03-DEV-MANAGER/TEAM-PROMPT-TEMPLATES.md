## üö® CRITICAL: EVIDENCE OF REALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: 80% of Round 1 implementations were hallucinated or broken!**

### BEFORE CLAIMING ANY COMPLETION:

1. **VERIFY FILES EXIST:**
```bash
# List your created files to prove they exist
ls -la $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/your-feature
# Show file contents
cat $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/main-file.tsx | head -20
```

2. **RUN TYPECHECK:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
# MUST show: "No errors found"
```

3. **RUN TESTS:**
```bash
npm test your-feature
# MUST show: "All tests passing"
```

4. **NO HALLUCINATED PATHS:**
- ‚ùå DO NOT claim files exist without creating them
- ‚ùå DO NOT write reports about non-existent code
- ‚ùå DO NOT confuse planning with implementation

5. **EVIDENCE IN COMPLETION REPORT:**
- Include `ls` output showing files exist
- Include typecheck results
- Include test run output
- Include actual code snippets from real files

**Teams that submit hallucinated work will be rejected immediately!**

## üß≠ CRITICAL: NAVIGATION INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY FOR ALL UI FEATURES)

**üö® PROJECT ORCHESTRATOR DIRECTIVE: Prevent Orphaned Features!**

### EVERY UI FEATURE MUST INTEGRATE INTO PARENT NAVIGATION

**‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Creating standalone pages without navigation integration**
**‚úÖ MANDATORY: All dashboards, pages, and components must connect to parent navigation**

#### NAVIGATION INTEGRATION CHECKLIST

1. **Dashboard Features (Admin/Analytics):**
```typescript
// MUST update main dashboard navigation
// File: $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx
// Add navigation item following existing pattern:
{
  title: "Your Feature Name",
  href: "/dashboard/your-feature",
  icon: LucideIconName
}
```

2. **Client-Specific Features:**
```typescript
// MUST integrate into client detail navigation
// File: $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/app/(dashboard)/clients/[id]/layout.tsx
// Add tab or section following pattern:
{
  label: "Your Feature",
  href: `/clients/${id}/your-feature`,
  current: pathname.includes('/your-feature')
}
```

3. **Settings/Management Features:**
```typescript
// MUST integrate into settings navigation
// File: $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/app/(dashboard)/team/page.tsx or similar
// Add settings section following existing pattern
```

4. **Mobile Navigation:**
```typescript
// MUST add mobile navigation support
// Ensure feature works in mobile drawer navigation
// Test on mobile viewports (375px width minimum)
```

#### COMPLETION CRITERIA: NAVIGATION INTEGRATION

**‚ö†Ô∏è FEATURE IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL NAVIGATION IS INTEGRATED**

- [ ] Desktop navigation link added
- [ ] Mobile navigation support verified
- [ ] Navigation states (active/current) implemented
- [ ] Breadcrumbs updated if applicable
- [ ] Accessibility labels for navigation items
- [ ] Navigation integration tested with Browser MCP

**EVIDENCE REQUIRED:**
```typescript
// Show navigation integration code:
// 1. Navigation component updates
// 2. Route definitions
// 3. Screenshots showing navigation in context
// 4. Mobile navigation testing results
```

**CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATION:**
- Feature will be marked as INCOMPLETE
- Code review will be REJECTED
- No deployment until navigation integration complete

---

## üîí CRITICAL: SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY FOR ALL API ROUTES)

**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY AUDIT REVEALED: 305+ API routes with ZERO validation! This stops NOW!**

### EVERY API ROUTE MUST HAVE:

1. **INPUT VALIDATION WITH ZOD:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS (FOUND IN 305+ ROUTES):
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json(); // NO VALIDATION!
  const { data } = await supabase.from('table').insert(body); // DIRECT INSERT!
  return NextResponse.json(data);
}

// ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS (MANDATORY PATTERN):
import { withSecureValidation } from '$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/validation/middleware';
import { yourSchema } from '$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/validation/schemas';

export const POST = withSecureValidation(
  yourSchema,
  async (request, validatedData) => {
    // validatedData is now type-safe and validated
    const { data } = await supabase.from('table').insert(validatedData);
    return NextResponse.json(data);
  }
);
```

2. **AUTHENTICATION ON PROTECTED ROUTES:**
```typescript
// MANDATORY for all protected routes:
const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
if (!session) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
}
```

3. **RATE LIMITING:**
```typescript
import { rateLimitService } from '$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/rate-limiter';

const result = await rateLimitService.checkRateLimit(request);
if (!result.allowed) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Rate limit exceeded' }, { status: 429 });
}
```

4. **SQL INJECTION PREVENTION:**
- NEVER concatenate SQL strings
- ALWAYS use parameterized queries
- ALWAYS validate with Zod first

5. **XSS PREVENTION:**
- NEVER render user input without sanitization
- Use secureStringSchema from validation/schemas
- HTML encode all output

### REQUIRED IMPORTS FOR EVERY API ROUTE:
```typescript
import { withSecureValidation, withValidation } from '$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/validation/middleware';
import { z } from 'zod';
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth';
import { authOptions } from '$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/auth/options';
import { rateLimitService } from '$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/rate-limiter';
```

### SECURITY CHECKLIST FOR EVERY ROUTE:
- [ ] Input validation with Zod schema
- [ ] Authentication check if protected
- [ ] Rate limiting applied
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS prevention
- [ ] CSRF protection (automatic with Next.js)
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] Audit logging for critical operations

**CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATION:**
- Code will be REJECTED immediately
- Security audit will flag your feature
- Production deployment will be BLOCKED
- You will rewrite everything with proper security

// Journey Builder UI (ONLY for Journey/Workflow features):
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/JOURNEY-BUILDER-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// Form Builder has slightly different UI but uses same base components
```

**üö® CRITICAL UI TECHNOLOGY STACK:**

# Add 2-3 more based on feature needs
```

### D. ANALYZE EXISTING PATTERNS (MINUTES 5-10)
```typescript
// Use Serena to understand how similar features are built
// Find patterns to follow, avoid reinventing the wheel
await mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols("[pattern-to-follow]");
```

## üß† STEP 2A: SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR COMPLEX FEATURE PLANNING

### When Sub-Agents Should Use Sequential Thinking

Before launching parallel agents, use **Sequential Thinking MCP** when facing:

- **Multi-System Features**: Components that span frontend, backend, database, and third-party integrations
- **Wedding Business Logic**: Complex rules around task delegation, guest management, or vendor coordination
- **Team Dependencies**: Features requiring coordination between multiple teams with shared APIs
- **Architecture Decisions**: Choosing between implementation approaches with long-term implications
- **Performance Constraints**: Features that could impact system performance or user experience

### Sequential Thinking Patterns for Sub-Agents

#### Pattern 1: Feature Complexity Analysis (Use BEFORE agent launch)
```typescript
// Complex feature assessment
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This feature requires: UI components (Team A), API endpoints (Team B), real-time updates (Team C), database changes (Team B‚ÜíSQL Expert), and integration with existing systems (Team C). Need to analyze dependencies and potential conflicts before teams start parallel work.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Dependency analysis: UI components need API contracts before development, real-time updates require backend event system, database schema changes affect all teams. Critical path: API design must complete before frontend development can begin.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding context considerations: Task tracking involves helpers (bridesmaids, family, vendors) with different permission levels. Critical tasks (venue confirmation) need photo evidence, non-critical tasks don't. Helper availability changes require task reassignment workflows.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Implementation strategy: 1) Design shared TypeScript interfaces first for team alignment, 2) Create API mocks for parallel frontend development, 3) Implement backend with comprehensive validation, 4) Add real-time layer, 5) Integration testing across teams.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

## üöÄ STEP 2B: LAUNCH ENHANCED AGENTS WITH SPECIFIC MISSIONS

   - **Sequential Thinking Usage**: Information architecture, documentation strategy, user journey mapping

**AGENT COORDINATION:** Agents work in parallel but share Serena insights AND Sequential Thinking analysis results

## üìã STEP 3: SERENA-ENHANCED DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### **EXPLORE PHASE (MANDATORY - NO CODING YET!)**
Use Serena to understand the codebase BEFORE writing any code:
```typescript
// Find all related components and their relationships
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("[component-name]", "", true);
// Understand existing patterns
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("[pattern-type]");
// Analyze integration points
await mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols("[integration-point]");
```
- [ ] Identified existing patterns to follow
- [ ] Found all integration points
- [ ] Understood security requirements
- [ ] Located similar implementations

### **PLAN PHASE (THINK ULTRA HARD!)**
Based on Serena analysis, create detailed plan:
- [ ] Architecture decisions based on existing patterns
- [ ] Test cases written FIRST (TDD)
- [ ] Security measures identified from code analysis
- [ ] Performance considerations from similar features

### **CODE PHASE (FOLLOW PATTERNS!)**
- [ ] Use patterns discovered by Serena
- [ ] Maintain consistency with existing code
- [ ] Include code examples in comments
- [ ] Test continuously during development

import { rateLimitService } from '$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/lib/rate-limiter';
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth';
```

### VALIDATION PATTERN (COPY THIS!):
```typescript
const schema = z.object({
  // Use secure schemas for strings
  name: secureStringSchema.max(100),
  email: emailSchema,
  // Strict enums
  status: z.enum(['active', 'inactive']),
  // Validated numbers
  amount: z.number().min(0).max(1000000),
  // Optional with defaults
  metadata: z.object({}).optional().default({})
});

export const POST = withSecureValidation(schema, handler);
```

## üé≠ PLAYWRIGHT TESTING

Revolutionary accessibility-first testing requirements:

```javascript
// REVOLUTIONARY TESTING APPROACH - Microsoft's Breakthrough!

// 1. ACCESSIBILITY SNAPSHOT ANALYSIS (GAME CHANGER!)
await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({url: "http://localhost:3000/[feature]"});
const accessibilityStructure = await mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot();
// Returns structured accessibility tree for LLM analysis - zero ambiguity!

// 2. MULTI-TAB COMPLEX USER FLOW (REVOLUTIONARY!)
await mcp__playwright__browser_tabs({action: "new", url: "/[feature-page-1]"});     // Tab 1
await mcp__playwright__browser_tabs({action: "new", url: "/[feature-page-2]"});     // Tab 2
await mcp__playwright__browser_tabs({action: "select", index: 0});                  // Switch tabs
await mcp__playwright__browser_drag({                                   // Test drag-drop
  startElement: "[source]", startRef: "[ref]",
  endElement: "[target]", endRef: "[ref]"
});
await mcp__playwright__browser_tabs({action: "select", index: 1});                  // Verify sync
await mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for({text: "Updated"});

// 3. SCIENTIFIC PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT (Real Metrics!)
const realMetrics = await mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate({
  function: `() => ({
    LCP: performance.getEntriesByType('largest-contentful-paint')[0]?.startTime,
    FCP: performance.getEntriesByType('paint').find(p => p.name === 'first-contentful-paint')?.startTime,
    TTFB: performance.timing.responseStart - performance.timing.fetchStart,
    loadTime: performance.timing.loadEventEnd - performance.timing.navigationStart,
    memoryUsage: performance.memory?.usedJSHeapSize || 0
  })`
});

// 4. ERROR DETECTION & CONSOLE MONITORING
const consoleErrors = await mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages();
const networkFailures = await mcp__playwright__browser_network_requests();
const failedRequests = networkFailures.filter(req => req.status >= 400);

// 5. RESPONSIVE VALIDATION (All Breakpoints)
for (const width of [375, 768, 1920]) {
  await mcp__playwright__browser_resize({width, height: 800});

## üéØ TEAM SPECIALIZATION TEMPLATES

### TEAM A TEMPLATE: Frontend/UI Focus
```markdown
## üß† SEQUENTIAL THINKING FOR UI DEVELOPMENT

### Frontend-Specific Sequential Thinking Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Complex UI Architecture Analysis
```typescript
// Before building complex UI components
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "This task tracking UI needs: drag-drop task reordering, real-time status updates, photo evidence modals, helper permission-based editing, and mobile touch optimization. Each component has different interaction patterns and state management needs.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "State management analysis: Task list needs global state for reordering, status updates require optimistic UI with rollback, photo uploads need progress tracking, permission checks affect which actions are available. Consider using Zustand for complex state, React Query for server state.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Component architecture: TaskCard (reusable across views), TaskModal (CRUD operations), PhotoUploader (evidence handling), PermissionGate (conditional rendering). Each needs proper TypeScript interfaces and error boundaries.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Wedding UX considerations: Brides will use this on mobile while coordinating vendors, helpers might access during busy schedules. Need offline capability, touch-friendly interactions, clear visual hierarchy, and graceful loading states.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4
});
```

## üìö ENHANCED SERENA + REF SETUP (Frontend Focus)

### A. SERENA UI PATTERN DISCOVERY
```typescript
// Find existing UI patterns to follow
await mcp__serena__search_for_pattern("component button form input");
await mcp__serena__find_symbol("Button Card Form", "", true);
await mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview("$WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/ui/");

// Analyze similar features for consistency
await mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols("useForm useState useEffect");
```

### B. UI STYLE GUIDES & UNTITLED UI/MAGIC UI SETUP
```typescript
// MANDATORY FIRST - Load correct UI Style Guide
// For general SaaS features:
await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/SAAS-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");
// For Journey Builder features ONLY:
// await mcp__serena__read_file("$WS_ROOT/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/JOURNEY-BUILDER-UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md");

// Load Untitled UI and Magic UI documentation
# Use Ref MCP to search for:
# - "Untitled UI components patterns"
# - "Magic UI animations effects transitions"

// Then load supporting documentation
# Use Ref MCP to search for:
# - "Next.js app-router components"
# - "Tailwind CSS responsive-design utilities"
# - "React Hook Form validation"
```

**üé® UI IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- **MUST use Untitled UI components** - No custom components unless extending Untitled UI
- **MUST use Magic UI for animations** - No custom animations
- **Form Builder UI**: Slightly different but uses same Untitled UI base
- **Journey Builder UI**: Special color palette and node-based interface

## üé® UI IMPLEMENTATION RULES (WITH SERENA VALIDATION)
- [ ] MUST use existing components from $WS_ROOT/wedsync/src/components/ui/ (Serena: find_symbol)
- [ ] MUST follow color system - NO hardcoded hex colors (Serena: verify patterns)
- [ ] MUST test at 375px, 768px, 1920px breakpoints (Playwright: resize & snapshot)
- [ ] MUST maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratios (Playwright: accessibility check)
- [ ] MUST support dark mode (Serena: find existing dark mode patterns)

## üéØ TYPICAL DELIVERABLES WITH EVIDENCE
- [ ] React components with TypeScript (Show: actual component code)
- [ ] Responsive UI (Evidence: screenshots at each breakpoint)
- [ ] Form validation and error handling (Code: validation schemas)
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (Playwright: accessibility tree)
- [ ] Component loads in <200ms (Metrics: actual load time)
- [ ] Touch targets ‚â•44x44px on mobile (Playwright: element measurements)

  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Security analysis: Status updates modify critical wedding data, photo uploads handle user files (security risk), history access reveals sensitive task details. Need authentication on all endpoints, input validation with Zod, file type validation, permission checks based on helper roles.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Validation requirements: Task status must be valid enum, user must own or be assigned to task, photos must be validated file types (<5MB, JPEG/PNG only), rate limiting for photo uploads to prevent abuse. Use secureStringSchema for all text inputs.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Implementation pattern: Use withSecureValidation middleware for all routes, implement helper permission verification, create reusable validation schemas for task data, add comprehensive error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information, include audit logging for critical operations.",

  totalThoughts: 4
});

mcp__sequential-thinking__sequential_thinking({
