## üéØ IDENTIFIED ISSUE: WS-297 EMPTY FILE

### üö® FILE STATUS PROBLEM
**File:** `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/WS JOBS/WS-297 Authentication System Main Overview/WS-297-team-a.md`
**Status:** Empty (0 bytes)
**Expected Content:** WS-297 Authentication System Main Overview specification
**Specification Verified:** ‚úÖ EXISTS at `/CORE-SPECIFICATIONS/01-TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE/Authentication System.md`

### ‚úÖ RESOLUTION VERIFICATION
**Feature:** WS-297 Authentication System Main Overview  
**Specification Path:** `/CORE-SPECIFICATIONS/01-TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE/Authentication System.md`
**Specification Status:** ‚úÖ EXISTS and contains complete authentication system overview
**Assignment Status:** ‚úÖ PROPERLY ASSIGNED in batch16-final (confirmed in feature-status.json:363)

**Root Cause:** The WS-297 team assignment file was created but never populated with content. The specification exists and is properly assigned - this is a downstream execution issue, not an orchestrator assignment issue.
