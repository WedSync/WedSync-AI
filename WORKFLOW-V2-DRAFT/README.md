   - Are we at [X]% complete? (Should increase 2% daily)
   - Update today's target

2. **Run the Workflow:**
   - FIRST: `07-WORKFLOW-MANAGER/README.md` (check workflow health & bottlenecks)
   - Start with `01-PROJECT-ORCHESTRATOR/README.md`
   - Then `02-FEATURE-DEVELOPMENT/README.md`
   - Then `03-DEV-MANAGER/README.md`
   - Then launch 15 dev teams with prompts from `session-prompts/active/`
   - Then `09-SENIOR-CODE-REVIEWER/README.md` (Guardian protection)
   - Then `06-SQL-EXPERT/README.md` (reviews ALL migrations from dev teams)
   - Finally `05-GIT-OPERATIONS/README.md` (if approvals exist)
   - END: `07-WORKFLOW-MANAGER/README.md` (update status & prepare for V3)

3. **Track Everything:**
