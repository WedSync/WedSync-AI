   - Any MD in INBOX/OUTBOX folders
   - Any MD in WS JOBS folders

2. **Name-based**:
   - Contains "handover" or "HANDOVER"
   - Contains "completion" or "COMPLETION"

   - Contains technical specifications
   - Contains workflow instructions

### DELETE Priority (Override default keep)
1. **Location-based**:
   - Everything in `/WORKFLOW-V3/`
   - Everything in `/TEST-WORKFLOW/`
   - Root level MD files (unless critical)

2. **Name-based**:
   - Contains "temp" or "draft" (unless recent)
   - Contains "test" (unless in active test suite)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è USER NOTES & WARNINGS

### From User:
> "Don't take this as gospel because I might be wrong"

### Safety Measures:
1. **Archive before delete** - Everything goes to archive first
2. **Review large deletions** - If deleting >50 files, create list for review
3. **Check references** - Ensure files aren't referenced in code
4. **Keep recent files** - If modified in last 7 days, keep by default

### Uncertainty Areas:
- Some handover documents location unknown
- Some completion reports may have non-standard names
- Some critical workflow files may not follow naming conventions

**Recommendation**: Run cleanup in phases:
1. Phase 1: Delete obvious targets (WORKFLOW-V3, TEST-WORKFLOW)
2. Phase 2: Archive old session logs and drafts
3. Phase 3: Manual review of edge cases
4. Phase 4: Final cleanup of validated deletions
