# üö® EMERGENCY CORRECTION PROMPT FOR DEV MANAGER üö®
## Critical Production Safety Issue - Immediate Action Required

---

## üìã IMMEDIATE INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Read Your Role Documentation
**FIRST**: Read your README file completely to understand your role and responsibilities as Dev Manager in the WedSync workflow.

### Step 2: Review Critical Audit Findings
**THEN**: Read these audit reports that expose critical hallucination contamination:
- `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/07-WORKFLOW-AND-AUDIT-MANAGER/output/2025-01-09-WS-295-383-HALLUCINATION-AUDIT-REPORT.md`
- `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/07-WORKFLOW-AND-AUDIT-MANAGER/output/EMERGENCY-HALT-LIST-WS-HALLUCINATIONS.md`

### Step 3: Confirm Feature Designer Corrections
**VERIFY**: That Feature Designer has completed their corrections (deletion of fabricated features and rewriting of corrupted legitimate features) before proceeding.

## üö® CRITICAL SITUATION OVERVIEW

**CONTAMINATION DETECTED**: The Feature Designer generated 29 fabricated features (33% hallucination rate) that DO NOT exist in CORE-SPECIFICATIONS. This contamination has potentially spread to your development team prompts in the WS JOBS folder.

### Your Role in Recovery:
As Dev Manager, you are responsible for:
1. **CLEANING** contaminated team prompts from WS JOBS folders
2. **DELETING** all development instructions for fabricated features  
3. **READING** newly corrected Feature Designer specifications
4. **REGENERATING** legitimate team prompts only for verified features
5. **ENSURING** no hallucinated work reaches development teams

---

## üéØ REQUIRED CORRECTIVE ACTIONS

### Phase 1: Emergency Cleanup (IMMEDIATE)
1. **DELETE** all team prompt files for RED CROSS fabricated features:
   - Remove entire WS JOBS folders for: WS-367, 368, 370, 371, 373-376, 379-383
   - Delete any team prompt files (team-a.md, team-b.md, etc.) for these features
   - Clean your INBOX of any contaminated feature assignments

2. **AUDIT** your output directory for contaminated job creation summaries:
   - Check files like `2025-XX-XX-WS-XXX-job-creation-summary.md`
   - Remove references to fabricated features
   - Document cleanup actions taken

### Phase 2: Verification and Regeneration (URGENT)
1. **READ** the corrected Feature Designer specifications:
   - Focus on rewritten features from Feature Designer OUTBOX
   - Verify each feature now maps to legitimate CORE-SPECIFICATIONS
   - Confirm removal of generic templates and fabricated themes

2. **REGENERATE** team prompts ONLY for verified legitimate features:
   - Use your standard team prompt generation process
   - Ensure each team prompt is based on corrected Feature Designer specs
   - Apply proper team assignments (A-G) and effort estimates
   - Include proper verification cycles as per your README

### Phase 3: Quality Control (MANDATORY)
1. **VALIDATE** all new team prompts against CORE-SPECIFICATIONS
2. **CROSS-REFERENCE** with GREEN TICK features from audit report
3. **ENSURE** no environmental, AR, ML, or streaming themes remain
4. **DOCUMENT** all cleanup and regeneration activities

rm -rf "WS JOBS/WS-367 Augmented Reality/"
rm -rf "WS JOBS/WS-368 Voice Assistant Integration/"
rm -rf "WS JOBS/WS-370 Predictive Analytics/"
# Continue for all RED CROSS features...
```

## ‚úÖ VERIFIED LEGITIMATE FEATURES (GREEN TICK)

### Safe to Generate Team Prompts For:
- **WS-295-300**: Technical Architecture ‚úÖ
- **WS-302-316**: WedSync Supplier Platform ‚úÖ  
- **WS-317-326**: WedMe Couple Platform ‚úÖ
- **WS-327-340**: Core Advanced Features ‚úÖ
- **WS-341**: Directory Discovery Features ‚úÖ

### Under Review (Proceed with Caution):
- **WS-342-366**: AWAIT AUDIT COMPLETION before generating team prompts

---

## üîç QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLIST

Before generating any team prompt:
- [ ] Feature appears in GREEN TICK list from audit report?
- [ ] Feature Designer specification has been rewritten/corrected?
- [ ] Feature maps to specific CORE-SPECIFICATIONS file?
- [ ] No generic template language present?
- [ ] No environmental/AR/ML/streaming themes?
- [ ] Business context is wedding-industry specific?
- [ ] Technical requirements are realistic and specification-based?
