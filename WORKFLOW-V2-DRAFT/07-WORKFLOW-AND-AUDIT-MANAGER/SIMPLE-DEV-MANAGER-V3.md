# üë®‚Äçüíº DEV MANAGER V3.0 - SIMPLIFIED WORKFLOW

## üéØ MAJOR OVERHAUL: SIMPLE JOB FOLDERS

**PROBLEM SOLVED:** No more complex batches, rounds, or nested folders that make tracking impossible!

**OLD COMPLEX WAY (V2):**
```
/OUTBOX/team-a/batch1/WS-001-team-a-round-1.md  
/OUTBOX/team-a/batch1/WS-001-team-a-round-2.md
/OUTBOX/team-a/batch1/WS-001-team-a-round-3.md
/OUTBOX/team-a/batch2/WS-016-team-a-round-1.md
...
(Result: 21 files per feature √ó multiple batches = impossible to track)
```

**NEW SIMPLE WAY (V3):**
```
/OUTBOX/WS-001/team-a.md  
/OUTBOX/WS-001/team-b.md
/OUTBOX/WS-001/team-c.md
/OUTBOX/WS-001/team-d.md
/OUTBOX/WS-001/team-e.md
(Result: 5 files per feature = easy to see what's missing!)
```

**INSTANT BENEFITS:**
- ‚úÖ **Easy tracking:** Missing team = missing file, obvious at glance
- ‚úÖ **No confusion:** One folder per job, no batch/round complexity  
- ‚úÖ **Clear progress:** Job folder complete = all 5 teams done
- ‚úÖ **Simple management:** Create folder ‚Üí add 5 prompts ‚Üí done
- ‚úÖ **Perfect scaling:** Works for any number of features

## YOUR WORKFLOW (DEAD SIMPLE)

### STEP 1: Check INBOX for Features
```bash
# Check what features need processing
ls /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/INBOX/dev-manager/WS-*.md

# Example: WS-047-review-collection-technical.md
```

### STEP 2: For Each Feature - Create Job Folder
```bash
# Read feature specification
# Validate it's a legitimate WedSync feature (not sales/payments)
# Create job folder

mkdir -p /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/WS-047/
```

### STEP 3: Generate 5 Team Prompts
```bash
# Create exactly 5 files:
/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/WS-047/team-a.md
/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/WS-047/team-b.md  
/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/WS-047/team-c.md
/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/WS-047/team-d.md
/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/WS-047/team-e.md
```

### STEP 4: Move to Next Feature
```bash
# Archive processed feature from INBOX
mv /INBOX/dev-manager/WS-047-*.md /INBOX/dev-manager/archive/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/

# Continue with next feature...
```

### STEP 5: Teams Work Independently
```bash
# Team A finds their prompt at: /OUTBOX/WS-047/team-a.md
# Team B finds their prompt at: /OUTBOX/WS-047/team-b.md
# etc.

# Teams complete work and create: /OUTBOX/WS-047/team-a-complete.md
# When all 5 complete files exist, job is done!
```

## FOLDER STRUCTURE EXAMPLE

**Simple job tracking:**

```
/OUTBOX/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WS-047/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team-a.md          (prompt for Team A)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team-b.md          (prompt for Team B)  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team-c.md          (prompt for Team C)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team-d.md          (prompt for Team D)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team-e.md          (prompt for Team E)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team-a-complete.md (Team A's output)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team-b-complete.md (Team B's output)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                (complete when all 5 teams done)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WS-048/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team-a.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team-b.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ WS-049/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [missing files = incomplete]
```

**At a glance you can see:**
- WS-047: Complete (all team files + completion files)
- WS-048: In progress (prompts created, teams working)
- WS-049: Incomplete (missing team files)

---

## FEATURE VALIDATION (CRITICAL)

**BEFORE creating prompts, validate each feature:**

### ‚ùå REJECT These Features (DO NOT CREATE PROMPTS):
- Client payment processing
- Sales quotes/proposals for couples  
- Lead management systems
- New client booking calendars
- Contract generation for client services
- Marketing automation for lead nurturing

### ‚úÖ ALLOW These Features (CREATE PROMPTS):
- Wedding day coordination tools
- Supplier dashboard features
- Wedding information sharing
- Guest management for existing weddings
- Photo sharing between vendors/couples
- Journey automation for wedding prep
- SaaS billing for supplier subscriptions

**If Feature is Invalid:**
1. Create: `/OUTBOX/dev-manager/WS-XXX-REJECTED.md`
2. Skip creating job folder
3. Move to next feature

## BENEFITS OF V3 SIMPLE SYSTEM

### For Management:
- **Clear visibility:** One folder = one job
- **Easy tracking:** Missing files = incomplete work  
- **Simple reporting:** Count folders vs count completion files
- **No confusion:** No batch numbers or round tracking needed

### For Teams:
- **Direct access:** Find your prompt at `/OUTBOX/WS-XXX/team-X.md`
- **Clear expectations:** One focused task per prompt
- **Simple completion:** Create completion file when done
- **No dependencies:** Work independently, integrate at end

### For Quality:
- **Complete coverage:** Must have all 5 team files
- **No overlap:** Each team has distinct responsibilities  
- **Clear boundaries:** Job folder contains everything for that feature
- **Easy review:** All related work in one place

## MIGRATION FROM V2 TO V3

**To transition existing work:**

1. **Archive V2 Structure:**
```bash
mkdir -p /OUTBOX/archive-v2/
mv /OUTBOX/team-* /OUTBOX/archive-v2/
```

2. **Create V3 Structure:**
```bash
# For each active feature, create new job folder
mkdir -p /OUTBOX/WS-XXX/
# Generate new simplified prompts
```

3. **Update Team Instructions:**
- Teams now look in `/OUTBOX/WS-XXX/team-X.md`
- Teams save completion to `/OUTBOX/WS-XXX/team-X-complete.md`
- No more batch/round tracking needed

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

**You're successful when:**
- ‚úÖ Every feature has exactly 5 team prompts (no more, no less)
- ‚úÖ Zero confusion about what's missing (empty folders are obvious)
- ‚úÖ Teams can find their work immediately (`/OUTBOX/WS-XXX/team-X.md`)
- ‚úÖ Progress tracking is visual (folder completion status)
- ‚úÖ No features fall through cracks (folder exists or doesn't)

**System Health Check:**
```bash
# Count incomplete jobs (folders with <5 prompts)
find /OUTBOX/WS-* -type d | while read dir; do
  count=$(ls "$dir"/team-*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
  if [ $count -lt 5 ]; then
    echo "INCOMPLETE: $dir has $count/5 prompts"
  fi
done

# Count completed jobs (folders with 5 completion files)  
find /OUTBOX/WS-* -type d | while read dir; do
  count=$(ls "$dir"/*-complete.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
  if [ $count -eq 5 ]; then
    echo "COMPLETE: $dir"
  fi
done
```
