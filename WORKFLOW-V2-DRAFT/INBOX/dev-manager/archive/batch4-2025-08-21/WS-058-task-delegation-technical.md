# TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION: WS-058 - Task Delegation System
## Generated by Feature Development Session - 2025-08-21

### USER STORY & BUSINESS CONTEXT (THINK HARD - BE FACTUAL)
**As a:** Bride overwhelmed with 47 wedding tasks
**I want to:** Delegate specific tasks to my bridal party and family
**So that:** I reduce stress and ensure nothing falls through the cracks

**Real Wedding Scenario:**
Sarah assigns "Pick up centerpieces Friday 2pm" to her sister Kate, "Coordinate morning hair appointments" to her maid of honor Lisa, and "Set up guest book table" to her dad. Each person gets notifications and can mark tasks complete. Sarah sees everything in one dashboard and sleeps better knowing her team is handling details.
