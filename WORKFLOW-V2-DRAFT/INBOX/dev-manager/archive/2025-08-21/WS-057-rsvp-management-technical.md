# TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION: WS-057 - RSVP Management System
## Generated by Feature Development Session - 2025-08-21

### USER STORY & BUSINESS CONTEXT (THINK HARD - BE FACTUAL)
**As a:** Couple managing 150 wedding invitations
**I want to:** Send digital RSVPs and track responses in real-time
**So that:** I can finalize catering counts 2 weeks before the wedding

**Real Wedding Scenario:**
Emma sends digital RSVP links to 150 guests. The system tracks that 89 have responded, 12 declined, and 49 haven't opened the invitation yet. She sees Aunt Mary marked "maybe" and calls to confirm. Final count: 127 attending, letting her confirm catering and avoid $500 in overage fees.
