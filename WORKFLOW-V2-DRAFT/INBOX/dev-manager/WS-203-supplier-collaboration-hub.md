**Date:** 2025-01-20  
**Feature ID:** WS-203  
**Priority:** P1 - Core supplier coordination  

## Technical Specification

### Feature Overview
Create a dedicated collaboration space where wedding suppliers can coordinate with each other and the wedding coordinator. This hub facilitates cross-vendor communication, timeline synchronization, and resource sharing for seamless wedding execution.

### User Story & Wedding Context
**As a:** Wedding photographer coordinating with DJ, florist, and venue coordinator  
**I want to:** Share setup timelines, coordinate arrival times, and communicate last-minute changes with other suppliers  
**So that:** All vendors work in harmony without conflicts or missed coordination  

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Wedding suppliers often work in silos, leading to setup conflicts, timeline mismatches, and poor coordination. A photographer might arrive at the same time as the florist, both needing the same space. Without a central communication hub, vendors rely on phone calls and texts, often missing critical updates.
