# WS-201 - Workflow Automation Engine

**Date:** 2025-01-20  
**Feature ID:** WS-201  
**Priority:** P1 - Core automation framework  

## Technical Specification

### Feature Overview
Build an intelligent workflow automation engine that triggers wedding coordination actions based on milestones, dates, and events. This system automates routine wedding planning tasks and ensures nothing falls through the cracks.

### User Story & Wedding Context
**As a:** Wedding coordinator managing multiple weddings  
**I want to:** Set up automated workflows that trigger reminders, tasks, and actions based on wedding milestones  
**So that:** Critical wedding preparation steps happen automatically without manual oversight  

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
Wedding planning involves dozens of time-sensitive tasks: "Send venue walkthrough reminder 2 weeks before," "Request final headcount 7 days before," "Confirm vendor arrival times 48 hours before." Coordinators manually track these, leading to missed deadlines and stressed couples.

### Technical Requirements

#### Core Automation Features
- **Milestone triggers**: Wedding date minus X days/weeks/months
- **Event-based triggers**: When task completed, supplier confirmed, payment received
- **Conditional logic**: If/then scenarios based on wedding data
- **Multi-step workflows**: Chain multiple actions together
- **Template library**: Pre-built workflows for common wedding scenarios

#### Automation Actions
- **Send notifications**: Email/SMS to couples, suppliers, coordinators
- **Create tasks**: Auto-generate checklists and assignments
- **Update statuses**: Mark milestones completed, change wedding stages
- **Generate documents**: Contracts, timelines, vendor briefs from templates
- **Integration triggers**: Connect with external services (calendar, CRM)

#### Workflow Types
- **Pre-wedding countdown**: 12-month to 1-day automated sequences
- **Vendor coordination**: Automatic briefings, confirmations, follow-ups
- **Client communication**: Progress updates, decision requests, reminders
- **Emergency protocols**: Backup supplier activation, weather contingencies
- **Post-wedding**: Thank you sequences, review requests, final deliverables

#### Technical Implementation
- **Backend**: Node.js workflow engine with cron job scheduling
- **Database**: Workflow definitions, execution history, trigger conditions
- **Queue system**: Redis-based job queue for reliable execution
- **Monitoring**: Dashboard for workflow performance and failure tracking
