**Date:** 2025-01-20  
**Feature ID:** WS-200  
**Priority:** P1 - Essential productivity feature  

## Technical Specification

### Feature Overview
Create advanced search and filtering capabilities across WedSync's core entities (clients, suppliers, events) to help wedding professionals quickly find and manage their wedding data.

### User Story & Wedding Context
**As a:** Wedding planner managing 50+ weddings simultaneously  
**I want to:** Apply multiple search filters and saved searches across clients, suppliers, and events  
**So that:** I can quickly locate specific wedding information without scrolling through hundreds of records  

**Real Wedding Problem This Solves:**
During peak wedding season, planners handle numerous concurrent weddings. They need to quickly find "all outdoor weddings in June with photography supplier issues" or "all clients with pending menu selections." Current basic search requires multiple page visits and mental filtering.

### Technical Requirements

#### Core Search Features
- **Multi-entity search**: Clients, suppliers, events, tasks in unified interface
- **Advanced filters**: Date ranges, status combinations, tag-based filtering
- **Saved searches**: Store frequently used filter combinations
- **Quick filters**: One-click common searches
- **Real-time filtering**: Results update as user types/selects

#### Filter Categories
- **Client filters**: Wedding date, budget range, venue type, guest count, status
- **Supplier filters**: Service category, availability, rating, location, certification status
- **Event filters**: Date range, event type, completion status, assigned planner
- **Cross-entity filters**: "Show clients missing supplier assignments"

#### Technical Implementation
- **Backend**: New `/api/search` endpoint with complex query building
- **Frontend**: Advanced search component with filter builder UI
- **Database**: Optimized indexes for search performance
- **Caching**: Redis layer for frequently accessed searches
