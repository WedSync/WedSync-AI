# TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION: WS-055 - Predictive Analytics Engine
## Generated by Feature Development Session - 2025-08-21

### USER STORY & BUSINESS CONTEXT (THINK HARD - BE FACTUAL)
**As a:** Wedding photographer with 40 booked couples
**I want to:** Predict which couples might cancel or need extra attention
**So that:** I can intervene early and save $12,000 bookings before they're lost

**Real Wedding Scenario:**
Photographer Tom's predictive model flags couple Jessica & David as 78% likely to cancel based on low engagement and delayed responses. Tom schedules a "wedding vision" call, discovers they're stressed about budget. He offers a payment plan and they stay booked, generating his highest-rated testimonial.

  accuracy_score DECIMAL(5,4),
  last_trained TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Predictions table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS predictions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  model_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES predictive_models(id),
  client_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES couples(id),
