# TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION: WS-040 - Activity Feed
## Generated by Feature Development Session - 2025-08-21

### USER STORY & BUSINESS CONTEXT (THINK HARD - BE FACTUAL)
**As a:** Wedding business owner who needs to stay informed about client interactions
**I want to:** See a real-time feed of all client activities (form submissions, email opens, profile updates)
**So that:** I can respond quickly to client actions and maintain engagement without constantly checking individual profiles

**Real Wedding Scenario:**
A photographer's activity feed shows: "Sarah & Mike viewed timeline form 2 hours ago", "Jennifer submitted venue details", "Alex opened sneak peek gallery", "Maria's wedding moved to October 15th". This allows immediate follow-up when engagement is highest.
