# TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION: WS-039 - Priority Widgets
## Generated by Feature Development Session - 2025-08-21

### USER STORY & BUSINESS CONTEXT (THINK HARD - BE FACTUAL)
**As a:** Wedding photographer who needs to prioritize urgent tasks among 50+ active clients
**I want to:** See dashboard widgets that highlight time-sensitive items requiring immediate attention
**So that:** I don't miss critical deadlines like timeline confirmations or delivery commitments that could damage client relationships

**Real Wedding Scenario:**
A photographer's dashboard shows: "3 couples need timeline confirmation by Friday", "2 weddings this weekend missing shot lists", "5 galleries overdue for delivery", "1 payment reminder sent 10 days ago". Each widget prioritizes by urgency and impact, preventing forgotten commitments.
