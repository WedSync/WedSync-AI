## Migration Details

### Migration File Path
```
/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/wedsync/supabase/migrations/20250828000001_review_collection_campaigns_system.sql
```

### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** Base user_profiles, suppliers, couples tables must exist
- **Order:** This migration should be applied after all base schema migrations
- **External Dependencies:** None - self-contained schema

### Migration Overview
Comprehensive review collection system database schema including:

1. **Core Tables** (6 main tables):
   - `review_campaigns` - Campaign management and configuration
   - `review_requests` - Individual review requests to clients
   - `collected_reviews` - Reviews received from clients
   - `campaign_analytics` - Performance metrics and statistics
   - `review_email_queue` - Email sending queue management
   - `client_review_preferences` - Client opt-in/opt-out settings

2. **Security Features**:
   - Complete RLS (Row Level Security) policies for all tables
   - Supplier-based access control
   - Client privacy controls
   - Audit trail support

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Strategic indexes for common query patterns
   - Optimized foreign key relationships
   - Query performance indexes

4. **Business Logic**:
   - Database triggers for automated updates
   - PostgreSQL functions for analytics calculations
   - Constraint validation for data integrity

### RLS Policies Summary
All tables implement comprehensive RLS policies:
- **Suppliers**: Can only access their own campaigns and related data
- **Clients**: Can access their own review requests and preferences
- **System**: Special policies for automated background processes

### Performance Considerations
- Indexes optimized for campaign listing, request tracking, and analytics queries
- Partitioning ready for high-volume review collection
- Efficient JOIN patterns for dashboard queries

### Validation Requirements
Please validate:
1. **Schema Integrity**: All foreign key relationships are correct
2. **RLS Security**: Policies prevent cross-supplier data access
3. **Performance**: Indexes cover expected query patterns
4. **Data Types**: All field types match application requirements
5. **Constraints**: Business rules enforced at database level

### Test Data Requirements
After migration application, please verify:
- Can create campaigns with proper supplier isolation
- Review requests link correctly to campaigns and clients  
- Analytics calculations work with sample data
- Email queue processing functions correctly
- RLS policies prevent unauthorized access

### Migration Verification Steps
1. Apply migration to development environment
2. Run basic CRUD operations on all tables
3. Test RLS policies with different user contexts
4. Verify all indexes are created properly
5. Confirm triggers and functions are working
6. Test cascade deletes and data integrity

### Rollback Plan
If rollback needed:
1. Drop all created tables in reverse dependency order
2. Remove any custom functions and triggers
3. Clean up any remaining sequences or types

### Contact Information
- **Requester**: Team B Developer
- **Feature ID**: WS-047
- **Urgency**: High Priority (P1)
- **Integration Dependency**: Blocks API endpoint testing and frontend development

## Additional Notes

This migration is the foundation for the entire review collection system. All API endpoints, background jobs, and frontend components depend on this schema being correctly applied.

The migration includes advanced PostgreSQL features:
- JSONB columns for flexible platform integration data
- Full-text search capabilities for review content
- Efficient querying patterns for analytics
- Comprehensive audit trail support

**Please confirm successful application and provide any optimization recommendations.**
