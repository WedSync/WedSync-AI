# Migration Request - WS-167 Trial Management System

**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Feature ID:** WS-167  
**Team:** Team D - Batch 20 - Round 1  
**Priority:** P1 (Critical Path)  
**Requester:** Senior Developer Team D  

---

## üìã MIGRATION OVERVIEW

**Migration File:** `20250826223450_ws_167_trial_system.sql`  
**Location:** `/wedsync/supabase/migrations/20250826223450_ws_167_trial_system.sql`  
**Purpose:** Enhanced trial management system with comprehensive lifecycle tracking, activity monitoring, and email automation

---

## üéØ TABLES TO BE CREATED

### 1. trial_tracking
- **Purpose:** Core trial lifecycle data and conversion metrics
- **Key Features:** Business context, engagement scoring, attribution tracking
- **Constraints:** Unique active trial per user, date validation
- **Dependencies:** auth.users, suppliers (optional)

### 2. trial_activity  
- **Purpose:** Daily activity metrics and detailed behavior tracking
- **Key Features:** Feature usage analytics, time saved calculations, device tracking
- **Constraints:** Date validation, performance metrics
- **Dependencies:** trial_tracking, auth.users

### 3. trial_email_schedule
- **Purpose:** Email automation and campaign management  
- **Key Features:** A/B testing, engagement metrics, trigger-based scheduling
- **Constraints:** Sequence validation, engagement tracking
- **Dependencies:** trial_tracking, auth.users

---

## üîí SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **All tables have RLS enabled**
- **User isolation:** Users can only access their own data
- **Service role access:** Full access for system operations
- **Join-based policies:** Proper foreign key relationship enforcement

### Specific Policies Created:
- `trial_tracking`: User ownership + service role access
- `trial_activity`: User ownership via trial relationship
- `trial_email_schedule`: User ownership + service role access

---

## ‚ö° PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

### Indexes Created (15 total):
**trial_tracking (8 indexes):**
- User ID, supplier ID, status, business type
- Date-based indexes for expiration and activity tracking
- Conversion probability for analytics

**trial_activity (7 indexes):**
- Trial ID, user ID, activity date
- Feature categorization and session tracking
- Composite indexes for common query patterns

**trial_email_schedule (6 indexes):**
- Campaign management and scheduling
- Email status and delivery tracking  
- Engagement metrics optimization

---

## üîß SPECIAL FEATURES

### Automated Triggers:
- `updated_at` column auto-update for trial_tracking
- `updated_at` column auto-update for trial_email_schedule

### Advanced Constraints:
- **Exclude constraints** for unique active trials
- **Check constraints** for data validation (dates, scores, enums)
- **Unique constraints** for sequence positioning

### Documentation:
- Comprehensive table and column comments
- Business context explanations for key metrics

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL CONFLICTS & CONSIDERATIONS

### 1. Existing Trial System:
- **Current system:** `trial_configs`, `trial_feature_usage`, `trial_milestones`, `trial_events`  
- **New system:** `trial_tracking`, `trial_activity`, `trial_email_schedule`
- **Relationship:** New system extends existing, no conflicts expected

### 2. Foreign Key Dependencies:
- **auth.users:** Standard dependency, should exist
- **suppliers:** Optional relationship, graceful handling if missing  
- **No blocking dependencies identified**

### 3. Enum Values:
- All enum constraints use wedding industry standard values
- Compatible with existing business logic

---

## üß™ TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### Pre-Migration Validation:
1. Verify `auth.users` table exists
2. Verify `update_updated_at_column()` function exists  
3. Check for naming conflicts with existing tables
4. Validate foreign key relationships

### Post-Migration Testing:
1. **RLS Policy Verification:**
   ```sql
   -- Test user isolation
   SET ROLE authenticated;
   SELECT * FROM trial_tracking; -- Should be empty for new user
   ```

2. **Constraint Testing:**
   ```sql
   -- Test unique active trial constraint
   INSERT INTO trial_tracking (user_id, business_type, trial_expires_at) 
   VALUES ('test-user-id', 'wedding_planner', NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days');
   -- Second insert should fail
   ```

3. **Index Performance:**
   ```sql
   -- Verify index usage
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM trial_activity 
   WHERE user_id = 'test-id' AND activity_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days';
   ```

---

## üìà EXPECTED IMPACT

### Database Size:
- **Estimated initial size:** Minimal (empty tables)
- **Growth projection:** ~10MB per 1000 active trials
- **Index overhead:** ~20% additional storage

### Performance:
- **Query optimization:** Significant improvement for trial analytics
- **Write performance:** Optimized for high-frequency activity tracking
- **Read performance:** Fast user-specific data retrieval

---

## üö® ROLLBACK PLAN

If migration fails or causes issues:

```sql
-- Emergency rollback (run in order)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS trial_email_schedule CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS trial_activity CASCADE;  
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS trial_tracking CASCADE;
```

**Note:** This rollback is safe as new tables have no dependencies from existing system.

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETION CHECKLIST

### Pre-Application:
- [ ] Review migration file syntax
- [ ] Validate foreign key dependencies  
- [ ] Check for naming conflicts
- [ ] Verify RLS policy syntax

### During Application:
- [ ] Apply migration in transaction
- [ ] Monitor for constraint violations
- [ ] Verify index creation success
- [ ] Test RLS policy enforcement

### Post-Application:
- [ ] Confirm all tables created successfully
- [ ] Verify index performance  
- [ ] Test data insertion/retrieval
- [ ] Document completion timestamp
