## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions & Rationale

### 1️⃣ **IndexedDB over LocalStorage**
**Decision**: Used IndexedDB for offline storage  
**Rationale**: Complex billing data structures, large invoice files, transaction safety

### 2️⃣ **Zustand over Redux**  
**Decision**: Zustand for state management  
**Rationale**: Simpler API, better TypeScript support, smaller bundle size

### 3️⃣ **Service Worker Caching Strategy**
**Decision**: Network-first for API calls, cache-first for assets  
**Rationale**: Fresh billing data when online, instant loading when offline

### 4️⃣ **Haptic Feedback Integration**
**Decision**: Native mobile haptic feedback for payment actions  
**Rationale**: Professional feel matching native payment apps

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### 🛡️ **Payment Security**
- **PCI Compliance**: All payment data handled by Stripe/Apple/Google
- **No card storage**: Zero card data touches WedSync servers
- **Merchant validation**: Proper Apple Pay merchant certificate validation
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All payment endpoints require SSL

### 🔐 **Data Protection**
- **Client-side encryption**: Sensitive billing data encrypted in IndexedDB
- **Request signing**: Payment requests include HMAC signatures  
- **Rate limiting**: Payment endpoints limited to 5 requests/minute
- **GDPR Compliance**: Personal data handling follows EU regulations
