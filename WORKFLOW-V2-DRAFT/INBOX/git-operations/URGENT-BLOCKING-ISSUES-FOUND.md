# üö® URGENT: GIT OPERATIONS BLOCKED - CRITICAL ISSUES
## Date: 2025-01-20 | Git Operations Session

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE HUMAN PM ATTENTION REQUIRED

**Git Operations has been ABORTED due to critical blocking issues that prevent safe commits:**

#### üö´ BLOCKER 1: TypeScript Compilation Failure
- **1000+ TypeScript errors** preventing any production deployment
- **Command:** `npm run typecheck` - FAILS
- **Impact:** Cannot safely commit ANY code until resolved

#### üö´ BLOCKER 2: Missing Approved Feature Files
**Approved features reference NON-EXISTENT files:**
- ‚úÖ WS-027 (Team B): Messaging components - EXISTS  
- ‚ùå WS-029 (Team D): Templates components - MISSING
- ‚ùå WS-030 (Team E): Monitoring library - MISSING
- ‚ùå WS-036 (Team A): Photos components - MISSING

### üîç WORKFLOW INTEGRITY PROBLEM

**How were features "APPROVED" when the code doesn't exist in the repository?**

This suggests a critical breakdown in the review/approval process:
1. Teams reported features as complete without committing code
2. Senior Dev approved based on missing implementations  
3. Approval document created referencing non-existent files

### üìã REQUIRED ACTIONS (URGENT)

#### For Human PM (Immediate):
1. **Emergency investigation**: How did 3 out of 4 approved features get approved without existing?
2. **Contact Team D, E, A**: Where are WS-029, WS-030, WS-036 implementations?  
3. **TypeScript resolution**: Assign team to fix 1000+ compilation errors
4. **Process audit**: Fix approval workflow to prevent this happening again

#### For Development Teams:
- **Team D**: Locate/commit WS-029 Journey Templates System
- **Team E**: Locate/commit WS-030 Journey Execution Engine  
- **Team A**: Locate/commit WS-036 Photo Management System
- **All Teams**: Priority fix for TypeScript compilation errors

### üéØ ONLY COMMITTABLE FEATURE (After TypeScript Fix):
- **WS-027 Message History System (Team B)** - Files exist, ready to commit

### üìä SESSION OUTCOME:
- **Commits Created:** 0 (safety first)
- **Repository Status:** Unchanged (protected from broken commits)
- **Next Session:** Cannot proceed until blocking issues resolved
