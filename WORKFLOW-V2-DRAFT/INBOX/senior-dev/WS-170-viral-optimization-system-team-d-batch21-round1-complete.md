## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### Core Architecture Pattern
```typescript
// Wedding Industry Context: Photographer → Happy Couple → Other Couples/Suppliers
ViralRewardEngine.calculateViralReward()
  → EligibilityValidator.validateViralEligibility()
    → SecurityValidator.validateRewardSecurity()
      → RewardWorkflowAutomation.processRewardWorkflow()
        → TierManager.updateUserTier()
```

### Viral Growth Mechanics Implemented
1. **Viral Coefficient Calculation**: Measures network effect (referrals made by referees)
2. **Network Depth Bonuses**: Rewards for multi-level referral chains
3. **Geographic Expansion**: Bonuses for reaching new markets
4. **Velocity Bonuses**: Rewards for fast referral generation
5. **Double-Sided Incentives**: Both referrer and referee receive rewards

### Database Schema Integration
- Extends existing `referral_rewards` and `referral_conversions` tables
- New tables: `viral_rewards`, `reward_validation_logs`, `security_assessments`
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies maintained
- Performance indexes for reward queries
