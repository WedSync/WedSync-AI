## 📊 EVIDENCE OF REALITY

### File Structure Verification
```bash
$ ls -la wedsync/src/app/api/mobile/
drwxr-xr-x background-sync/
drwxr-xr-x emergency/
drwxr-xr-x photos/
drwxr-xr-x queue/
drwxr-xr-x realtime/
drwxr-xr-x sync/
drwxr-xr-x wedding/
```

### Core API Endpoint Verification
```bash
$ cat wedsync/src/app/api/mobile/sync/route.ts | head -20
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Sync request schema validation
const syncRequestSchema = z.object({
  lastSyncTimestamp: z.string().datetime(),
  deviceId: z.string().min(1),
  weddingIds: z.array(z.string().uuid()),
  ...
```

### Database Migration Success
