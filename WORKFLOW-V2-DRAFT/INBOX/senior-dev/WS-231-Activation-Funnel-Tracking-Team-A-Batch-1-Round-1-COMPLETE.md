✅ activation_alerts         # Automated alert configuration
✅ user_alert_history        # Alert delivery tracking
```

### API Endpoints (4 New Routes)
```typescript
✅ POST /api/activation/events          # Track activation events
✅ GET  /api/activation/events          # Retrieve event history
✅ GET  /api/activation/status/[userId] # User activation status
✅ GET  /api/activation/analytics       # Funnel performance analytics
✅ POST /api/activation/analytics       # Generate daily analytics
✅ GET  /api/activation/alerts          # Alert management
✅ POST /api/activation/alerts          # Create new alerts
✅ PUT  /api/activation/alerts          # Process/trigger alerts
```

### Frontend Components (2 Major Dashboards)
```typescript

✅ UserActivationProgress       # User progress tracking widget
```

### Service Layer & Hooks
```typescript

✅ useActivationTracking        # React hook for tracking
✅ Specialized tracking hooks   # Signup, onboarding, forms, etc.
```

## 🎯 ACTIVATION FUNNEL DEFINITION

### Standard Wedding Vendor Activation Journey (100 Points Total)
1. **Account Created** (10 pts) - User completes registration
2. **Onboarding Completed** (20 pts) - Finishes setup wizard  
3. **First Client Import** (25 pts) - Adds existing clients
4. **First Form Sent** (25 pts) - Sends form to client
5. **First Response Received** (15 pts) - Client responds
6. **Automation Setup** (5 pts) - Creates first automation

### Activation Scoring System
- **0-29 points**: At Risk (needs immediate intervention)
- **30-59 points**: In Progress (normal progression)
- **60-79 points**: Nearly Complete (encourage completion)
- **80-100 points**: Fully Activated (success!)

## 🚨 AUTOMATED ALERT SYSTEM

### Alert Types Implemented
- **Drop-off Alerts**: Users inactive for 7+ days
- **Slow Progress**: Users with score <30 after 3 days
- **Stalled Activation**: Users stuck at same step for 5+ days

### Notification Channels
- **Email**: Personalized activation guidance emails
- **In-App**: Contextual help notifications
- **Slack**: Team alerts for high-value user drop-offs

## 📊 ANALYTICS & INSIGHTS

### Real-Time Dashboards
- **Funnel Conversion Rates**: Step-by-step conversion tracking
- **User Distribution**: Active, at-risk, completed segments
- **Daily Trends**: New users and completions over time
- **Drop-off Analysis**: Users requiring intervention

### Key Metrics Tracked
- Overall activation completion rate
- Time-to-activation distribution
- Step-specific conversion rates
- Alert effectiveness measurements

## 🔧 INTEGRATION POINTS

### Seamless App Integration
```typescript
// Easy event tracking throughout the app
import { trackSignupCompleted, trackClientImported } from '@/lib/activation/activation-service';

// Example usage in signup flow
await trackSignupCompleted({ email, source: 'registration_form' });

// Example usage in client import
await trackClientImported({ count: 15, method: 'csv_upload' });
```

### React Hooks for Components
```typescript
// Use in any component to show user progress
const { status, shouldShowGuidance, nextStep } = useActivationTracking();

// Specialized hooks for different areas
const { trackFormSent } = useFormTracking();
const { trackAutomationCreated } = useAutomationTracking();
```

## 🛡️ SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ Users can only access their own activation data
- ✅ Admins can view organization-wide analytics
- ✅ System processes use service role authentication
- ✅ All API endpoints have proper authentication

### Rate Limiting
- ✅ Event tracking: 50 req/min per IP
- ✅ Analytics: 100 req/min per IP
- ✅ Alert processing: 5 req/min per IP

### Data Privacy
- ✅ GDPR compliant event storage
- ✅ User consent tracking
- ✅ Data retention policies implemented

## 📋 DATABASE FUNCTIONS

### Automated Processing
```sql
✅ calculate_activation_score()           # Dynamic score calculation

✅ generate_daily_funnel_analytics()      # Daily metrics generation
✅ trigger_update_activation_status()     # Auto-trigger on event insert
```

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Strategic indexes on high-query columns
- ✅ JSONB indexing for event metadata
- ✅ Partitioning-ready table structure
- ✅ Optimized queries for real-time dashboards
