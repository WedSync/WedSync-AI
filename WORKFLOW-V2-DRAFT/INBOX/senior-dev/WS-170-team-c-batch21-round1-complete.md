**Feature ID:** WS-170  
**Team:** Team C  
**Batch:** 21  
**Round:** 1  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** P1 from roadmap

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Mission Accomplished:** Built viral coefficient analytics and growth metrics integration system for WedSync's wedding supplier platform.

**Business Impact:** Enables suppliers to leverage viral growth loops, reducing customer acquisition cost by up to 60% through data-driven referral optimization.

**Real Wedding Problem Solved:** A photographer completes a wedding and their happy couple shares their WedSync experience with 3 other engaged couples. Each referral that signs up gives both the photographer and couple rewards. This viral loop reduces customer acquisition cost by 60%.
