## ðŸš€ ANIMATION HIGHLIGHTS

### Countdown Animations
```typescript
// Number ticker animation for live countdown updates
<AnimatePresence mode="wait">
  <motion.span
    key={timeRemaining}
    initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -10 }}
    animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
    exit={{ opacity: 0, y: 10 }}
  >
    {timeRemaining}
  </motion.span>
</AnimatePresence>
```

### Celebration Effects
```typescript
// Item completion celebration with star burst
{celebratingItem === item.id && (
  <motion.div
    initial={{ scale: 0, rotate: 0 }}
    animate={{ scale: [0, 1.2, 0], rotate: 360 }}
    transition={{ duration: 1 }}
  >
    <Star className="w-16 h-16 text-yellow-400" />
  </motion.div>
)}
```

### Progress Animations
```typescript
// Animated progress bar with shine effect
<motion.div
  initial={{ width: 0 }}
  animate={{ width: `${completionPercentage}%` }}
  transition={{ duration: 1, ease: "easeOut", delay: 0.2 }}
