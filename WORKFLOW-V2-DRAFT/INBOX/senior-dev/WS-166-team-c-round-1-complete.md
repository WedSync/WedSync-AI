## Integration Readiness

### ✅ Production Configuration
**Environment Variables Required**:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Service role key for storage operations
- `JWT_SECRET` or `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - JWT signing secret
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Base URL for download links

**Supabase Setup**:
- Storage bucket: 'budget-exports' (configured)
- Database table: 'budget_export_files' (RLS enabled)
- Row Level Security policies (applied)

### ✅ API Integration Ready
All services are designed for seamless integration with Next.js API routes:
```typescript
// Example API route integration
import { ExportFileManager } from '@/lib/integrations/budget-export/file-manager';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { exportId, fileName, fileBuffer, contentType, coupleId } = await request.json();
  
  const result = await ExportFileManager.storeExportFile(
    exportId, fileBuffer, fileName, contentType, coupleId
  );
  
  return Response.json(result);
}
```

## Testing & Validation

### ✅ Test Coverage Areas
1. **File Storage Operations**: Upload, download, metadata retrieval
2. **Security Boundaries**: Unauthorized access prevention, token validation
3. **Compression Workflows**: ZIP creation, PDF optimization, format detection  
4. **Email Delivery**: Multi-stakeholder scenarios, template rendering, failure handling
5. **Cleanup Operations**: Expired file removal, emergency scenarios, batch processing
6. **Error Handling**: Network failures, quota exceeded, corrupted files
