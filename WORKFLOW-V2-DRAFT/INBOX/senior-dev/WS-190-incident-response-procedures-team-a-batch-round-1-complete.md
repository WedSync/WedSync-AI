## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Main Dashboard Integration
import { 
  IncidentDashboard,
  IncidentTimeline, 
  GDPRComplianceTracker,
  EmergencyResponsePanel 
} from '@/components/admin/security';

// Mobile Response Integration  
import { MobileSecurityDashboard } from '@/components/mobile/security';

// Supporting Components
import {
  IncidentCard,
  SeverityIndicator, 
  ContainmentActions,
  EvidencePreservation,
  NotificationCenter
} from '@/components/security/incident';
```

### Real-Time Integration Pattern
```typescript
// WebSocket connection for live incident updates
useEffect(() => {
  const ws = new WebSocket(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL}/incidents`);
  
  ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const update = JSON.parse(event.data);
    if (update.type === 'incident_update' && update.isWeddingDay) {
      // Special wedding day protocol activation
      activateWeddingDayProtocol(update);
    }
  };
}, []);
```

### Wedding Day Protocol Logic
```typescript
const isWeddingDay = () => {
  const today = new Date();
  return today.getDay() === 6; // Saturday
};

const getWeddingImpactLevel = (severity: SeverityLevel, isWeekend: boolean) => {
  if (isWeekend && severity === 'P1') return 'critical_wedding_impact';
  if (isWeekend && severity === 'P2') return 'moderate_wedding_impact';  
  return 'minimal_wedding_impact';
};
```
