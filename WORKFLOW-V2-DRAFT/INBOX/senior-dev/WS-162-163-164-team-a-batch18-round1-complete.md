4. **Offline Support**: Requires internet connection for real-time features

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Performance Testing**: Load testing with large wedding datasets
2. **E2E Testing**: Comprehensive Playwright test suite implementation
3. **Analytics Integration**: Enhanced reporting and insights features
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Native mobile app development

## Conclusion

Successfully delivered three interconnected wedding management features with enterprise-grade security, real-time capabilities, and mobile-responsive design. All components integrate seamlessly with the existing WedSync platform architecture while maintaining high performance and user experience standards.

The implementation provides a solid foundation for wedding couples to manage their budgets effectively and coordinate helper schedules efficiently, with appropriate access controls for all stakeholder types.
