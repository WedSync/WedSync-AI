**Missing Components** (Referenced by tests but don't exist):
```typescript
/components/task-delegation/
├── TaskDelegation.tsx                 // Main delegation interface
├── HelperManagement.tsx              // Helper invitation & management
├── TaskAssignment.tsx                // Assignment workflows  
├── TaskStatus.tsx                    // Status management & evidence
├── TaskDelegationDashboard.tsx       // Dashboard overview
├── TaskCreationForm.tsx              // Task creation interface
