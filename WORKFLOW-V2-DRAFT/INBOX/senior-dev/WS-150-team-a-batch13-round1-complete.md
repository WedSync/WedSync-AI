## INTEGRATION POINTS READY

### API Endpoints Expected
✅ **Alert Dashboard APIs:**
- `GET /api/audit/metrics` - Real-time system metrics
- `GET /api/audit/trends?timeRange={timeRange}` - Historical trend data
- `GET /api/audit/alerts?limit=10` - Recent alerts
- `WebSocket /api/audit/monitoring/stream` - Real-time updates

✅ **Investigation Interface APIs:**
- `GET /api/audit/events` - Paginated event listing with filters
- `POST /api/audit/export` - Event export functionality

✅ **Alert Management APIs:**
- `GET /api/audit/alerts` - Alert listing
- `GET /api/audit/alert-rules` - Rule management
- `GET /api/audit/alert-statistics` - Statistics data
- `GET /api/audit/notification-settings` - Settings retrieval
- `POST /api/audit/alerts/{id}/acknowledge` - Alert actions
- `POST /api/audit/alerts/{id}/resolve` - Alert resolution
- `PATCH /api/audit/alert-rules/{id}` - Rule updates
- `PUT /api/audit/notification-settings` - Settings updates

### WebSocket Integration
- **Connection Management**: Automatic connection with fallback to polling
- **Message Types**: Support for `metrics_update`, `trend_update`, `alert` message types
