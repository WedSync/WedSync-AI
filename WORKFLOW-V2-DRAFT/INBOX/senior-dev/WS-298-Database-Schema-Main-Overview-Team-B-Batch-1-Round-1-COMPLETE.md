## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Architecture Analysis

### Core Schema Structure
```sql
-- 31 Core Tables Analyzed
organizations (root tenant isolation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user_profiles (authentication & roles)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clients (wedding couples & contacts)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ weddings (core wedding data)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ forms (dynamic questionnaires)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ form_responses (client submissions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ communications (vendor-client messaging)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ messages (real-time chat)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integrations (third-party connections)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ subscriptions (pricing & billing)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [22 additional supporting tables]
```

### Multi-Tenant Architecture ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Excellent Implementation:**
- Clean tenant boundaries through `organization_id` foreign keys
- Shared-tenant model optimizing resource usage  
- Proper data isolation preventing cross-tenant leakage
- Scalable design supporting thousands of wedding vendors

### Table Relationships & Foreign Keys ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚ö°
**Comprehensive Relationship Model:**
- 31 core tables with proper referential integrity
- Cascading deletes protecting data consistency  
- Junction tables for many-to-many relationships
- Audit trails via created_at/updated_at timestamps

## üîê Security Assessment - CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Row Level Security (RLS) - URGENT ACTION REQUIRED
**Current Status:** RLS policies completely missing across all tables

**Critical Security Vulnerability:**
```sql
-- URGENT: All 31 tables need RLS policies
-- Example implementation needed:
ALTER TABLE clients ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "clients_org_isolation" ON clients 
    FOR ALL USING (organization_id = auth.jwt() ->> 'organization_id');
```

### Data Protection Measures üõ°Ô∏è
**Strengths:**
- UUID primary keys prevent enumeration attacks
- Soft deletes with 30-day recovery period
- Audit timestamps on all tables

**Critical Gaps:**
- No encryption at rest for sensitive data
- Missing data masking for PII fields
- No field-level encryption for payment data

## üöÄ Performance Optimization Requirements

### Missing Critical Indexes
**High-Impact Performance Issues Identified:**

```sql
-- RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ADDITIONS:
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_clients_organization_active 
ON clients(organization_id, is_active) WHERE is_active = true;

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_weddings_date_status 
ON weddings(wedding_date, status) WHERE status != 'cancelled';

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_forms_org_created 
ON forms(organization_id, created_at DESC);
```

### Wedding Day Critical Paths üéØ
**Saturday Performance Requirements (<200ms):**
- Vendor dashboard queries
- Emergency contact lookups  
- Real-time messaging
- Form submissions

## üíº Business Logic Implementation

### Pricing Tier Enforcement ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚ö´
**Good Foundation, Enhancement Needed:**

Current subscription model in place but missing:
- Usage tracking and limits enforcement
- Feature flags per pricing tier
- Automated tier upgrade/downgrade logic

### Wedding Industry Features ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Excellent Industry Adaptation:**
- Wedding date immutability after confirmation
- Guest management with dietary requirements
- Vendor coordination through communications
- Timeline management for wedding day
- Custom questionnaires for different vendor types

## üéØ Critical Recommendations & Action Items

### üî¥ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (This Week)
1. **URGENT: Implement RLS policies** on all 31 tables - Security vulnerability
2. **Add performance indexes** for Saturday wedding day queries
3. **Create usage tracking** tables for pricing tier enforcement
4. **Implement basic GDPR compliance** structure

### üü° SHORT-TERM (Next Month)
1. Add comprehensive data retention policies
2. Enhance integration framework with field mappings
3. Implement automated data archiving procedures
