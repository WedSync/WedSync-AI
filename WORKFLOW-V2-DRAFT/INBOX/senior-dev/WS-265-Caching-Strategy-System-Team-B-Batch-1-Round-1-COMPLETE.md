## 🏗️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. Core Architecture Components

**WeddingAwareCacheManager** (`/src/lib/cache/wedding-cache-manager.ts`)
- Multi-layer caching with Redis, CDN, and browser cache coordination
- Intelligent TTL calculation based on wedding proximity (1 day = 25% TTL, 7 days = 50% TTL)
- Automatic compression for data >1KB using lz-string
- Priority-based caching (critical, high, normal, low)
- Concurrent operation deduplication to prevent cache stampede
- Graceful error handling with fallback mechanisms

**Cache Configuration System** (`/src/lib/cache/config.ts`)
- Flexible configuration for all cache layers
- Wedding-specific data type categorization
- Performance tuning parameters
- Environment-specific settings (development vs production)

**Performance Monitor** (`/src/lib/cache/performance-monitor.ts`)
- Real-time metrics collection and analysis
- Performance alerting with configurable thresholds
- Comprehensive reporting with recommendations
- Cache health scoring and optimization suggestions

### 2. Wedding-Aware Intelligence

**Intelligent TTL Calculation:**
```typescript
// TTL automatically adjusts based on wedding timing
- Wedding Day (0 days): TTL / 8 (critical freshness)
- Week Before (≤7 days): TTL / 2 (high freshness) 
- Month Before (≤30 days): TTL * 0.75 (balanced)
- Far Future (>30 days): Full TTL (efficiency focus)
```

**Data Type Prioritization:**
- **Critical**: wedding_details, guest_list, timeline, vendor_contacts, venue_info, emergency_contacts
- **High Frequency**: rsvp_status, seating_chart, menu_selections, photo_requests
- **Static**: vendor_profiles, package_details, pricing_tiers, help_content

**Pre-warming Strategy:**
- Automatically triggers for weddings within 30-day priority window
- Pre-loads all critical data types and related vendor information
- Runs asynchronously to avoid blocking user operations

### 3. Multi-Layer Architecture

**Layer 1: Redis (Primary)**
- Fastest access with <10ms average latency
- Handles all data types with compression
- Connection pooling with retry logic
- Memory-efficient with LRU eviction

**Layer 2: CDN Cache**
- Static and public data caching
- Geographic distribution for global access
- Automatic cache header management
- Integration with Cloudflare/CloudFront

**Layer 3: Browser Cache**
- Client-side caching with service worker
- Offline capability for critical wedding data
- Automatic cache invalidation
- Progressive Web App optimization
