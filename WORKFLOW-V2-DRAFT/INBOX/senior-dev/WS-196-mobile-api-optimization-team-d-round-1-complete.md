## üöÄ Technical Architecture

### Mobile Context Detection
```typescript
export interface MobileContext {
  deviceType: 'mobile' | 'tablet' | 'desktop';
  connectionType: '4g' | '3g' | '2g' | 'wifi' | 'ethernet';
  batteryLevel?: number;
  isLowPowerMode?: boolean;
  screenSize: { width: number; height: number; };
}
```

### Intelligent API Optimization
- **Image Quality Adaptation**: 60% for low power mode, 50-85% based on connection
- **Payload Compression**: Automatic null/undefined removal, field filtering
- **Cache Strategy**: 1 hour for 2G, 30 minutes for 3G, 5 minutes for 4G/WiFi
- **Vendor Limiting**: 10 for mobile, 20 for tablet, unlimited for desktop

### Wedding-Specific Business Logic
- **Payment Status Conflicts**: Server always wins for payment-related updates
- **Form Submissions**: Client wins for recent submissions (< 5 minutes)
- **Communication Merging**: Preserves all messages, merges by timestamp
- **Timeline Updates**: Local changes preserved, new server items merged

## üé® PWA Service Worker Features

### Caching Strategies
```typescript
const WEDDING_API_PATTERNS = {
  realtime: ['/api/bookings/', '/api/payments/', '/api/notifications/'],
  cacheable: ['/api/vendors/', '/api/venues/', '/api/forms/'],
  networkFirst: ['/api/timeline/', '/api/communications/'],
  cacheFirst: ['/api/portfolio/', '/api/gallery/']
};
```

### Background Sync Integration
- Priority-based sync queue (critical > high > medium > low)
- Exponential backoff for failed requests
- Cross-device sync broadcasting
- Offline request persistence with IndexedDB

## üì± Mobile Performance Optimizations
