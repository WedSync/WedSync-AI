2. AI Generation → Merge Tag Processor (with caching)  
3. Template Processing → Email Service Integration
4. Email Delivery → Webhook Performance Tracking
5. Analytics Processing → Real-time Dashboard Updates
```

### 🏗️ Reliability Patterns Implemented:
- **Circuit Breaker**: 5 failure threshold, 30s timeout, 60s half-open
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket (1000/min, 10k/hour)
