## Technical Architecture

### Wedding-Specific Optimizations

1. **Priority-Based Caching**:
   - Critical: Wedding timeline, vendor contacts, emergency info
   - High: Photo galleries, guest lists, seating charts
   - Medium: General content, blog posts, marketing materials
   - Low: Historical data, analytics, archived content

2. **Intelligent Sync Coordination**:
   - Wedding day data gets highest priority in sync queues
   - Conflict resolution with vendor and couple preference rules
   - Cross-device consistency with change propagation
   - Network-aware sync with bandwidth optimization

3. **Context-Aware Notifications**:
   - Wedding-specific notification templates
   - Priority-based notification delivery
   - Offline action queuing with smart batching
   - Cross-platform notification consistency

### Integration Points

- **React Integration**: Context providers and hooks for component usage
- **Supabase Integration**: Real-time subscription coordination
- **IndexedDB Integration**: Large wedding portfolio storage
- **Service Worker Integration**: Main thread communication channels
