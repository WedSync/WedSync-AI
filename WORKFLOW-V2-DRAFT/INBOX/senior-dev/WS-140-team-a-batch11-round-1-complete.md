## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions

#### Component Design Philosophy
- **Composition over inheritance**: Each component accepts configuration props for maximum flexibility
- **Separation of concerns**: Business logic handled in custom hooks, UI logic in components
- **Wedding industry UX**: Specialized messaging, color schemes, and interaction patterns
- **Accessibility-first**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance built into every component

#### State Management Strategy
- **SWR for server state**: Automatic caching, revalidation, and error handling
- **Local component state**: For UI interactions, temporary states, and form handling
- **Supabase realtime**: For live updates across trial_configs, trial_milestones, and trial_feature_usage tables
- **localStorage**: For user preferences (banner dismissal) and offline capability

#### API Integration Patterns
- **RESTful endpoints**: `/api/trial/status`, `/api/trial/track-usage`, `/api/trial/achieve-milestone`
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation with retry mechanisms and user-friendly error messages
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript integration with existing trial type definitions
- **Caching strategy**: SWR with 5-minute refresh intervals for optimal performance

### Performance Optimizations

#### Bundle Size Management
- **Tree shaking**: Only imported necessary Lucide React icons
- **Component lazy loading**: Dynamic imports for non-critical components
- **Code splitting**: Separate chunks for trial management functionality

#### Runtime Performance
- **Memoization**: React.useMemo and React.useCallback for expensive calculations
- **Event batching**: Activity tracking batched to reduce API calls (default: 10 events per batch)
- **Debounced updates**: Real-time countdown updates optimized to prevent excessive re-renders

#### Accessibility Implementation
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy, form labels, and landmark roles
- **ARIA attributes**: Comprehensive aria-labels, aria-describedby, and live regions
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full tab order support with visible focus indicators
- **Screen reader support**: Descriptive text for complex UI elements
