## 🔄 Component Integration

### TrialStatusWidget Integration
```typescript
// Usage in dashboard
<TrialStatusWidget 
  showActivityScore={true}
  compact={false}
  refreshInterval={30000}
  onUpgradeClick={() => router.push('/billing')}
  onActivityUpdate={(score) => trackActivity(score)}
/>
```

### TrialChecklist Integration  
```typescript
// Usage in onboarding/dashboard
<TrialChecklist
  collapsed={false}
  showActivityScore={true}
  highlightNextAction={true}
  refreshInterval={60000}
  onItemComplete={(itemId) => trackCompletion(itemId)}
  onActivityUpdate={(score) => updateEngagementScore(score)}
/>
```

## 🛡️ Security Implementation Details

### Input Sanitization
All user-provided content passes through `sanitizeHTML()` function:
```typescript
// Sanitization implementation
import { sanitizeHTML } from '@/lib/security/input-validation';
const safeBusinessType = sanitizeHTML(data.trial?.business_type || '');
```

### Data Bounds Validation
Numeric values are clamped to safe ranges:
```typescript
// Bounds validation implementation  
days_remaining: Math.max(0, Math.floor(data.progress?.days_remaining || 0)),
progress_percentage: Math.min(100, Math.max(0, data.progress?.progress_percentage || 0)),
roi_percentage: Math.min(1000, Math.max(0, data.progress?.roi_metrics?.roi_percentage || 0))
```

### Authentication Verification
API endpoints verify user access:
```typescript
// Authentication check in API routes
const { data: { user }, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
if (error || !user) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
}
```
