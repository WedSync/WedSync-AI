## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Wedding Industry Privacy Requirements ✅
- **Cross-Wedding Isolation**: Strict RLS policies prevent users from accessing broadcasts outside their wedding contexts
- **Role-Based Access**: Suppliers, coordinators, and couples have different broadcast permissions
- **Wedding Day Protection**: Non-critical broadcasts blocked on Saturdays to protect live weddings
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all broadcast creation and acknowledgment activities

### API Security Measures ✅
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid Supabase authentication
- **Server-Side Validation**: Zod schemas validate all inputs with detailed error responses  
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam with role-based multipliers and priority adjustments
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs validated and sanitized before database operations
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: All queries use parameterized statements via Supabase client

### Data Protection ✅
- **RLS Policies**: Every sensitive table protected with Row Level Security
- **Wedding Context Validation**: Users can only access broadcasts within their wedding boundaries
- **Premium Feature Validation**: Tier-based access controls for SMS and push notifications
- **Error Handling**: Security-conscious error messages that don't leak sensitive information
