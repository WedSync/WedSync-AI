## 📊 WEDDING BUSINESS LOGIC

### Priority Scoring System:
- **Active Wedding**: +1000 priority points
- **Saturday Wedding Day**: +500 priority points  
- **Critical Operation**: +300 priority points
- **Transaction**: +200 priority points
- **Write Operation**: +100 priority points
- **Read Operation**: +50 priority points

### Wedding Load Classification:
- **Critical**: 20+ weddings or 2000+ guests
- **High**: 10+ weddings or 1000+ guests
- **Medium**: 5+ weddings or 500+ guests  
- **Low**: <5 weddings and <500 guests

### Emergency Scaling Triggers:
- **Saturday with 5+ weddings**: 3x scaling (critical urgency)
- **Critical predicted load**: 2.5x scaling (critical urgency)
- **High predicted load**: 2x scaling (high urgency)
- **10+ active weddings**: 1.5x scaling (medium urgency)
