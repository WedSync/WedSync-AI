**Q: What happens during wedding day disasters?**
A: Emergency recovery mode activates for weddings within 24 hours, enabling parallel recovery processes, priority vendor data restoration, and real-time status updates to minimize wedding day disruption.

**Q: How is wedding data prioritized during recovery?**
A: Three-tier priority system: Critical data (users, suppliers, clients) recovered first within 15 minutes, High priority data (forms, timelines, files) within 1 hour, Standard data (communications, profiles) within 4 hours.

**Q: What security measures prevent unauthorized backup access?**  
A: Super admin authentication required, JWT token validation, role-based access control, organization-scoped permissions, comprehensive audit logging, and rate limiting prevent unauthorized access and abuse.
