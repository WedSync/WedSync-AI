## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Component Composition Pattern**
   - Each component is self-contained with clear prop interfaces
   - Shared state management through custom hooks
   - Separation of concerns between UI and business logic

2. **Real-time Architecture**
   - Supabase Realtime for database changes
   - Broadcast channels for user collaboration
   - Optimistic updates with fallback recovery

3. **API Integration Strategy**
   - Service layer abstraction for Team B APIs
   - TypeScript-first approach with full type safety
   - Error boundaries and graceful degradation

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Virtual Scrolling**: Large time slot lists use virtual rendering
2. **Debounced Updates**: Real-time updates are debounced to prevent UI thrashing
3. **Memoization**: Heavy computations are memoized with React.useMemo
4. **Code Splitting**: Components are lazy-loaded where appropriate

### Accessibility Features

1. **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**:
   - Proper ARIA labels and roles
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader announcements
   - High contrast color ratios
   - Minimum touch target sizes (44px)

2. **Mobile-First Design**:
   - Responsive breakpoints starting at 375px
   - Touch-friendly interaction patterns
   - Gesture support for drag-and-drop

## 🔗 INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING CODEBASE

### Round 1 Integration
- Built upon existing `PhotoGroupManager.tsx` and `PhotoGroupBuilder.tsx`
