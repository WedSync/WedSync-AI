### ✅ One-Handed Operation Design
- **Thumb Reach Zone Analysis:**
  - Comfortable Zone: Bottom 40% (green) - Priority actions placed here
  - Stretch Zone: Middle 30% (yellow) - Secondary actions  
  - Difficult Zone: Top 30% (red) - Avoided for critical functions
- **Device Size Adaptations:**
  - Small devices (≤375px): 60px critical touch targets
  - Medium devices (375-414px): 56px critical touch targets  
  - Large devices (≥414px): 56px with bottom-heavy layout

### ✅ Context-Aware Styling & Emergency Mode
- **Photo Context:** High-contrast slate colors, camera-friendly design
- **Client Context:** Professional blue theme, communication-focused
- **Schedule Context:** Organized green theme, swipe navigation optimized
- **Emergency Context:** High-visibility red with pulse animations and haptic alerts

### ✅ Performance & Accessibility Compliance
