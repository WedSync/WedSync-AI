- **Medium Risk (50-70%):** Feature discovery email
- **Low Risk (70-85%):** Engagement boost email

### Cooldown Periods
- Critical: 24 hours
- High: 72 hours (3 days)
- Medium: 168 hours (1 week)
- Low: 336 hours (2 weeks)

### Tracking Metrics
- Email delivery rate
- Open rate tracking
- Click-through rate
- Conversion tracking

## 📈 Performance Considerations

1. **Batch Processing:** Limited to 10 suppliers per batch to prevent overload
2. **Caching:** Redis used for cooldown management (1-hour TTL for metrics)
3. **Async Operations:** All email sends are non-blocking
4. **Rate Limiting:** Respects email provider limits
5. **Error Recovery:** Graceful degradation on service failures

---

## 🔒 Security Implementation

1. **Authentication:** All endpoints require authenticated user
2. **Webhook Verification:** HMAC signature validation
3. **Data Sanitization:** All user inputs validated with Zod
4. **Email Suppression:** Automatic handling of bounces and complaints
5. **Privacy Compliance:** Unsubscribe management and preference tracking
