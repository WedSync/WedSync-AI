```typescript
// Security pattern implemented
const handleSecureClick = useCallback((e: React.TouchEvent | React.MouseEvent) => {
  if ('touches' in e && e.touches.length > 1) return; // Prevent touch jacking
  if (isRateLimited()) return; // Rate limit protection
  
  const sanitizedEvent = sanitizeTouchEvent(e);
  onClick?.(sanitizedEvent);
}, [onClick]);
```
