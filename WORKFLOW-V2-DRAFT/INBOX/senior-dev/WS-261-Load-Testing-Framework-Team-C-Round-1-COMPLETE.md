# WS-261 Load Testing Framework Integration - Team C - Round 1 - COMPLETE

## 🎯 TASK SUMMARY
**FEATURE ID**: WS-261  
**TEAM**: C (Integration)  
**SPRINT**: Round 1  
**STATUS**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**COMPLETION DATE**: September 4, 2025  

### Wedding User Story Fulfilled ✅
> **As a DevOps engineer monitoring wedding platform health**, I need real-time integration between our load testing system and external monitoring tools (DataDog, New Relic, PagerDuty) so when we're testing Saturday evening guest rush scenarios, I can immediately see the impact on our entire infrastructure and get alerted if any wedding-critical thresholds are breached.

> **As a wedding platform operations manager**, I need automated notifications when load tests reveal performance issues that could affect couples' wedding day experience, so I can proactively address problems before they impact real celebrations.
