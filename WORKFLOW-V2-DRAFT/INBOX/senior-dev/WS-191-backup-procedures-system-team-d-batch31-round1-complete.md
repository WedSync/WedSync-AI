## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 📱 Mobile-First Architecture
```typescript
// Battery-efficient polling strategy
const getPollingInterval = () => {
  if (!isOnline) return 60000 // 60s when offline
  if (mobileOptimized) {
    if (batteryLevel < 20) return 60000 // 60s on low battery  
    return 30000 // 30s on mobile
  }
  return 5000 // 5s on desktop
}

// Touch target compliance
const TouchButton = {
  minHeight: '44px',
  minWidth: '44px', 
  fontSize: '16px',
  padding: '12px 16px'
}
```

### ⚙️ Service Worker Caching Strategy
```javascript
// Network-first with cache fallback
if (event.request.url.includes('/api/backups/')) {
  return handleBackupApiRequest(event.request)
}

// Cache critical resources for offline access
const BACKUP_ENDPOINTS = [
  '/api/backups/status',
  '/api/backups/health', 
  '/api/backups/current'
]
```

### 🎨 Responsive Design Implementation
```css
/* Mobile-first breakpoint strategy */
.backup-dashboard {
  /* Mobile: 320px-767px */
