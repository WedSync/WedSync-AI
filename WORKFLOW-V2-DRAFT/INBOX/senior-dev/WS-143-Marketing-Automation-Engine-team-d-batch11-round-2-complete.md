**Implementation Evidence:**
```typescript
// File: src/lib/services/ai-content-generator.ts:151-186
static async generateEmailSubjectLines(
  campaignContext: CampaignContext, 
  count: number = 5
): Promise<SubjectLineVariants> {
  const contextPrompt = `Generate ${count} wedding industry email subject lines for:
  - Campaign: ${campaignContext.campaignType}
  - Recipient: ${campaignContext.recipientType} (${campaignContext.recipientRole})
  - Season: ${campaignContext.season}
  - Relationship: ${campaignContext.relationship}
  - Goal: ${campaignContext.goal}
  
  Requirements:
  - Wedding industry-specific language and context
  - Personalized based on recipient role and relationship
  - Optimized for ${campaignContext.goal} goal
  - Include predicted open rates and confidence scores`;
  
  // AI processing with OpenAI GPT-4...
}
```

CASE 
  WHEN channel_source = 'viral_invitation' THEN attribution_weight * 1.2
  WHEN channel_source = 'referral' AND industry_context = 'wedding' THEN attribution_weight * 1.1
  WHEN touchpoint_type = 'venue_recommendation' THEN attribution_weight * 1.15
  ELSE attribution_weight
END as final_attribution_weight
```

### Behavioral Intelligence ✅
AI-driven behavioral profiling with wedding industry insights:
```typescript
// File: src/lib/services/behavioral-segmentation-service.ts:128-156
generateBehaviorProfile(): {
