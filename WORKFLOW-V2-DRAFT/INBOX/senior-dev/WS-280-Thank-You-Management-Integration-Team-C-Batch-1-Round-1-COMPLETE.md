## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS**

### **Code Quality & Architecture**
```typescript
// Example: Intelligent delivery method selection
private async chooseOptimalDeliveryMethod(delivery: ThankYouDelivery): Promise<string> {
  const { data: gift } = await this.supabase
    .from('thank_you_gifts')
    .select('gift_value, gift_category')
    .eq('id', delivery.giftId)
    .single()

  const giftValue = gift?.gift_value || 0
  
  // High-value gifts get premium treatment
  if (giftValue > 200 || gift?.gift_category === 'experience' || delivery.priority === 'urgent') {
    if (delivery.recipientAddress) return 'postal'
  }

  // Fallback cascade: email > postal > sms > hand_delivery
  if (delivery.recipientEmail && this.isValidEmail(delivery.recipientEmail)) {
    return 'email'
  }
  // ... additional fallback logic
}
```

### **Robust Error Handling**
```typescript
// Example: Comprehensive fallback mechanism
private async attemptFallbackDelivery(
  delivery: ThankYouDelivery, 
  originalError: any
): Promise<DeliveryResult> {
  const fallbackMethods = delivery.deliveryPreferences.backupMethods || ['email', 'postal', 'sms']
  
  for (const method of fallbackMethods) {
    try {
      const result = await this.routeDelivery(delivery, method)
      if (result.success) {
        await this.logFallbackSuccess(delivery, method, originalError)
        return result
      }
    } catch (fallbackError) {
      console.error(`Fallback method ${method} also failed:`, fallbackError)
    }
  }
  
  return { success: false, error: 'All delivery methods failed', retryable: true }
}
```

### **Wedding-Specific Features**
```typescript
// Example: Wedding context awareness in gift matching
private async matchGiftToRegistry(gift: any, registryItems: GiftRegistryItem[]): Promise<GiftMatchResult> {
  let bestMatch: GiftRegistryItem | undefined
  let highestScore = 0
  
  for (const registryItem of registryItems) {
    let score = 0
    
    // Name similarity (40% weight)
    const nameScore = this.calculateNameSimilarity(gift.description, registryItem.itemName)
    score += nameScore * 40
    
    // Price similarity (30% weight, within 20% tolerance)
    if (Math.abs(gift.value - registryItem.price) / registryItem.price < 0.2) {
      score += 30
    }
    
    // Category matching (20% weight)
    if (this.matchCategories(gift.category, registryItem.category)) {
      score += 20
    }
    
    // Availability bonus (10%)
    if (registryItem.quantity.remaining > 0) {
      score += 10
    }
    
    if (score > highestScore) {
      highestScore = score
      bestMatch = registryItem
    }
  }
  
  return { confidence: Math.min(Math.round(highestScore), 100), matchedRegistryItem: bestMatch }
}
```
