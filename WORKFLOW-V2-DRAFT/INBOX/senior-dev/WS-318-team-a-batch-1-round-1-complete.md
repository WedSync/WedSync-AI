- Real-time field validation for mobile UX optimization
```

### Personalization Engine  
```typescript  
// Dynamic content based on context
- Inviting vendor type (photographer, venue, planner)
- Seasonal recommendations (spring/summer/autumn/winter)
- Location-based pricing (London vs regional)
- Budget optimization with breakdown suggestions
```

### Analytics Foundation
```typescript
// Comprehensive event tracking  
- 20+ event types for optimization
- A/B testing infrastructure ready
