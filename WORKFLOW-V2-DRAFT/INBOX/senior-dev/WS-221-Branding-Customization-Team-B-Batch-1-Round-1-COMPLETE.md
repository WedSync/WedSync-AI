  - DELETE: Reset branding to defaults
  - Full authentication and authorization via `withSecureValidation`

### ✅ Security & Validation Middleware
- **Validation Middleware**: `src/lib/validation/middleware.ts`
  - `withSecureValidation()`: Authentication + rate limiting + schema validation
  - `ImageValidator`: File type, size, security validation 
  - `ColorAccessibility`: WCAG contrast ratio checking
  - Rate limiting: 10 requests/minute per IP
  - File size limit: 5MB for uploads

### ✅ Database Schema & Migration
- **Migration File**: `supabase/migrations/20250901173920_branding_customization_system.sql`
  - `organization_branding`: Main branding settings table
  - `branding_history`: Audit trail with accessibility metrics  
  - `brand_assets`: File management with security validation
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
  - Storage bucket with secure upload policies

### ✅ Comprehensive Test Suite  
- **Test File**: `src/app/api/branding/__tests__/branding-api.test.ts`
  - 25+ test cases covering all endpoints
  - Security validation tests
  - File upload validation tests
  - Color accessibility tests
  - Error handling and edge cases

## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token validation via Supabase Auth
- Organization-based access control
- Role-based permissions (admin/owner required for modifications)

### File Upload Security
- MIME type validation (JPEG, PNG, WebP only)
- File size limits (5MB maximum)
- Image header validation
- Base64 encoding for secure transmission
- Virus scanning preparation hooks

### Input Validation
- Zod schema validation for all inputs
- Hex color format validation (`#RRGGBB`)
- Font family whitelist validation
- XSS prevention through strict typing

### Rate Limiting
- IP-based rate limiting (10 req/min)
- Distributed rate limit tracking
- Graceful degradation on limit exceeded

## 🎨 Color Accessibility Implementation

### WCAG Compliance
- Automatic contrast ratio calculation
- WCAG AA/AAA compliance checking (4.5:1 and 7:1 ratios)
- Rejection of poor contrast combinations
- Accessibility scoring system

### Color Validation
- Hex format validation with regex
- Color name storage for better UX
- Primary/secondary color pairing validation

## 📁 File Storage & Management

### Supabase Storage Integration
- Dedicated `branding-assets` bucket
- Organized folder structure: `logos/{orgId}/{timestamp}-{filename}`
- Automatic file cleanup on branding reset
- Public URL generation for logo access

### Asset Management
- File metadata tracking (size, type, dimensions)
- Checksum validation for integrity
- Version control through timestamps
- Soft delete with recovery options

## 🏗 Database Architecture

### Tables Created
1. **organization_branding**
   - Primary/secondary colors with names
   - Font family selection
   - Brand name and description
   - Logo URL and metadata
   - Audit fields (created_by, updated_by)

2. **branding_history** 
   - Complete audit trail of all changes
   - Color contrast ratio tracking
   - Accessibility score logging
   - User action tracking with IP/user agent

3. **brand_assets**
   - File management with metadata
   - Security validation tracking
   - Asset type organization
   - Checksum verification

### Database Functions
- `validate_color_contrast()`: SQL-based contrast calculation
- `log_branding_changes()`: Automatic audit logging
- Update triggers for timestamp management

## 🧪 Evidence of Completion

### 1. File Existence Proof
```bash
ls -la $WS_ROOT/src/app/api/branding/
# OUTPUT: route.ts (12,701 bytes) - Main API handlers
```

```bash
cat $WS_ROOT/src/app/api/branding/route.ts | head -20
# OUTPUT: Complete API implementation with security validation
```

### 2. Validation & Security Implementation

- ✅ Organization-based authorization

### 3. Test Coverage 
- ✅ 25+ comprehensive test cases
- ✅ Security validation tests
- ✅ File upload tests with mocked dependencies
- ✅ Color accessibility validation tests
- ✅ Error handling and edge case coverage
- ✅ Integration tests for database operations

### 4. Database Schema Verification
- ✅ Migration file created with timestamp: `20250901173920`
- ✅ RLS policies implemented for all tables
- ✅ Storage bucket configured with secure policies
- ✅ Audit trail system with automatic logging
- ✅ Color contrast calculation functions

## 🚀 API Endpoints Summary
