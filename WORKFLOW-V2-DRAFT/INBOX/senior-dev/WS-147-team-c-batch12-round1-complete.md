## 🔍 CODE QUALITY EVIDENCE

### 1. **Robust Error Handling**
```typescript
// Example from auth-security-service.ts
static async checkRateLimit(
  identifier: string,
  type: 'login' | 'password_reset' | 'mfa_verify' = 'login'
): Promise<RateLimitResult> {
  try {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('check_rate_limit', {...});
    if (error) throw error;
    return { allowed: data.allowed, ... };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Rate limit check failed:', error);
    // Graceful fallback - allow attempt if check fails
    return { allowed: true, remainingAttempts: 5, ... };
  }
}
```

### 2. **Comprehensive Type Safety**
```typescript
export interface PasswordStrengthResult {
  score: number;
  feedback: {
    warning?: string;
    suggestions: string[];
  };
  meetsRequirements: boolean;
  requirements: {
    minLength: boolean;
    hasUpperCase: boolean;
    hasLowerCase: boolean;
    hasNumbers: boolean;
    hasSpecialChars: boolean;
    notCommon: boolean;
  };
}
```

### 3. **Security-First Design**
```sql
-- Encrypted storage for sensitive data
mfa_secret TEXT, -- Encrypted TOTP secret
mfa_backup_codes TEXT[], -- Encrypted backup codes

-- Automatic expiration handling
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth_security.check_rate_limit(...)
RETURNS JSONB AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Automatic lock and expiration logic
  IF v_current_attempts >= p_max_attempts THEN
    INSERT INTO auth_security.rate_limits (
      locked, locked_until, lock_duration_minutes
    ) VALUES (
      true, NOW() + (p_window_minutes || ' minutes')::INTERVAL, p_window_minutes
    );
  END IF;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```
