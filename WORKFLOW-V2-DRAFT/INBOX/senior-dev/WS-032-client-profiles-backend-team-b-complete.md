const profilePerformance = await page.evaluate(async () => {
  const start = performance.now()
  const response = await fetch('/api/clients/test-client-id')
  const data = await response.json()
  const end = performance.now()
  
  return {
    responseTime: end - start,
    hasWeddingDetails: !!data.wedding_date,
    hasActivityFeed: Array.isArray(data.activities)
  }
})

expect(profilePerformance.responseTime).toBeLessThan(500)
```
