## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Database Schema Highlights:
```sql
-- Health Score Calculation with Multiple Dimensions
overall_health_score DECIMAL(5,2) CHECK (overall_health_score >= 0 AND overall_health_score <= 100)
engagement_score DECIMAL(5,2) CHECK (engagement_score >= 0 AND engagement_score <= 100) 
progress_score DECIMAL(5,2) CHECK (progress_score >= 0 AND progress_score <= 100)
churn_risk_score DECIMAL(5,2) CHECK (churn_risk_score >= 0 AND churn_risk_score <= 100)

-- Advanced JSONB for Flexible Metadata
features_used JSONB DEFAULT '{}' -- {"feature_name": usage_count}
factors_considered JSONB DEFAULT '{}' -- Score calculation transparency
ai_suggested_actions JSONB DEFAULT '{}' -- ML-powered recommendations

-- Automated Timestamp and SLA Management
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_support_interactions_updated_at
    BEFORE UPDATE ON support_interactions
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_support_interactions_updated_at();
```

### Performance Index Examples:
```sql
-- Composite Dashboard Query Optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_health_dashboard_main 
    ON customer_health(organization_id, overall_health_score DESC, calculated_at DESC);

-- SLA Compliance Tracking
CREATE INDEX idx_support_interactions_sla_tracking 
    ON support_interactions(sla_response_met, sla_resolution_met, created_at DESC);

-- JSONB Search Optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_success_milestones_custom_fields 
    ON success_milestones USING GIN (custom_fields);
```
