# WS-031 CLIENT LIST VIEWS - TEAM A COMPLETION REPORT

**Date:** 2025-08-21  
**Feature ID:** WS-031  
**Team:** Team A  
**Status:** COMPLETE ‚úÖ  
**Round:** 1 of 3 (Core Implementation)

## üìã FEATURE SUMMARY

**Mission Accomplished:** Implemented flexible client list views with four format options (list, grid, calendar, kanban) enabling wedding photographers to efficiently manage and organize their client workflows.

**Real Wedding Problem Solved:** Wedding photographers can now switch between calendar view for scheduling, grid view for visual couple identification, and kanban view for tracking planning stages, eliminating the need for multiple external tools.
