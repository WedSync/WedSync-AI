```
1. Couple creates wedding on WedMe (free)
   ‚Üì
2. System identifies missing vendor categories  
   ‚Üì
3. AI generates targeted vendor invitations
   ‚Üì
4. Vendors join WedSync to collaborate
   ‚Üì
5. Vendors recommend other vendors
   ‚Üì
6. Network effect amplifies growth exponentially
```

#### Growth Multiplier System
- **Base Viral Coefficient**: 1.5+ (each user brings 1.5 new users)
- **Network Effect Multiplier**: 5x through vendor networks
- **Invitation Conversion Rate**: 15%+ (industry-leading)
- **Retention Amplification**: 75% improvement through collaboration

### Intelligent Invitation Engine
```typescript
// Advanced vendor matching algorithm
const vendorMatch = await viralGrowthEngine.generateVendorInvitations(
