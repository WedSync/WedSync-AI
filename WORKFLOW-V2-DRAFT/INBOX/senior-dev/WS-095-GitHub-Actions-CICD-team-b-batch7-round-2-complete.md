## 🚨 CRITICAL NOTES

### Wedding Day Protection
- **ACTIVE:** System blocks deployments/rollbacks during active weddings
- **Override:** Available only in emergency mode with explicit confirmation
- **Database Query:** Checks `clients` table for wedding_date = CURRENT_DATE

### Security Considerations
- All secrets stored in GitHub encrypted secrets
- Production deployments require 2 approvals
- Security scans run daily and on every PR
- High/Critical vulnerabilities block deployment

### Performance Monitoring
- Performance gates run before every deployment
- Thresholds based on wedding industry SLA requirements
- Automated rollback triggered on performance degradation
