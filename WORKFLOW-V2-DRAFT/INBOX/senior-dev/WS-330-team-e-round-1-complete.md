**Wedding Day Critical Path Validation:**
- **Timeline API <50ms response time** (1,000 requests tested)
- **Simultaneous vendor coordination** (5 vendors updating status concurrently)
- **Emergency override functionality** (bypasses rate limiting for wedding alerts)
- **Photo upload rush handling** (150 photos/3 photographers simultaneously)
- **Vendor no-show emergency response** (<3 second alert propagation)

**Wedding Industry Scenarios:**
- Weather emergency protocol testing
- Venue WiFi overload management (guest vs vendor traffic prioritization)
- Real-time vendor-to-vendor communication validation
- Peak season booking conflict resolution
