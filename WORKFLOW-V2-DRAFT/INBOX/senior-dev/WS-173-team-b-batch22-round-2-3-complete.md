## Key Technical Implementations

### Advanced Caching Strategy
```typescript
// Multi-tier cache with intelligent routing
export class CacheManager {
  async get<T>(key: string): Promise<T | null> {
    // L1: Memory cache (sub-millisecond)
    let result = await this.memoryCache.get<T>(key);
    if (result) return result;
    
    // L2: Redis cache (<5ms)
    result = await this.redisCache.get<T>(key);
    if (result) {
      await this.memoryCache.set(key, result, 60); // Warm L1
      return result;
    }
    
    // L3: Database with CDN fallback
    return this.fetchWithCDN<T>(key);
  }
}
```

### Database Query Optimization
```typescript
// Intelligent query planning with performance tracking
export class QueryOptimizer {
  async executeWithOptimization<T>(query: string): Promise<T[]> {
    const plan = await this.analyzePlan(query);
    const optimizedQuery = this.applyOptimizations(query, plan);
    
    const startTime = performance.now();
    const result = await this.db.query<T>(optimizedQuery);
    const duration = performance.now() - startTime;
    
    // Track performance for continuous optimization
    await this.trackPerformance(query, duration);
    
    return result;
  }
}
```

### Performance Monitoring Integration
```typescript
// Real-time performance tracking
export class PerformanceMonitor {
  async trackAPICall(endpoint: string, duration: number): Promise<void> {
    // Real-time dashboard updates
    await this.updateDashboard(endpoint, duration);
    
    // Alert if performance degrades
    if (duration > this.thresholds[endpoint]) {
      await this.triggerAlert(endpoint, duration);
    }
    
    // Store for historical analysis
    await this.storeMetric(endpoint, duration);
  }
}
```
