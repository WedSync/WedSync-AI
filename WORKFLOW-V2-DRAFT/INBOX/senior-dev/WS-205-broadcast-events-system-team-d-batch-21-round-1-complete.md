## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### High-Performance Queue System
**File**: `/src/lib/broadcast/performance/broadcast-queue-manager.ts`

```typescript
// Redis Cluster with Priority-Based Processing
- Critical Priority: 8 workers, 10ms delay
- High Priority: 6 workers, 50ms delay  
- Normal Priority: 4 workers, 100ms delay
- Low Priority: 2 workers, 500ms delay

// Auto-Scaling Worker Pool
- Base Workers: 20 across all priorities
- Auto-Scale Threshold: 10,000 queue items
- Max Concurrent Workers: 50
- Monitoring Interval: 30 seconds
```

**Key Features**:
- Redis Cluster high availability with 3-node configuration
- Dynamic batch sizing (25-500 users per batch based on load)  
- Exponential backoff retry logic with priority-based max attempts
- Real-time metrics collection and worker auto-scaling

### Intelligent Caching Strategy  
**File**: `/src/lib/broadcast/performance/broadcast-cache-manager.ts`

```typescript
// Two-Tier Caching Architecture
Local LRU Cache:
- Capacity: 5,000 items
- Memory Limit: 50MB
- TTL: 5 minutes
- Hit Rate Target: 95%+

Redis Cluster Cache:
- User Preferences: 5 minutes TTL
- Broadcast Data: 1 hour TTL (immutable)
- Wedding Team Data: 15 minutes TTL
- Segment Users: 30 minutes TTL (expensive calculations)
```

**Wedding Industry Optimizations**:
- Wedding season data preloading for upcoming events
- Wedding team member caching with fast invalidation
- Segment-based user caching for targeted broadcasts
- Memory pressure monitoring with automatic cache resizing

### Auto-Scaling for Wedding Season
**File**: `/src/lib/broadcast/performance/auto-scaler.ts`

```typescript
// Wedding Season Rules (May, June, September, October)
Aggressive Scaling:
- 5,000 connections → scale out (5 min cooldown)
- 1,000 queue size → scale out (3 min cooldown)  
- 500ms latency → scale out (5 min cooldown)
- 2% error rate → scale out (10 min cooldown)

// Normal Season Rules  
Conservative Scaling:
- 10,000 connections → scale out (10 min cooldown)
- 2,000 connections → scale in (20 min cooldown)
```

**Predictive Scaling Features**:
- Wedding date-based capacity planning 2 hours in advance
- Weekend traffic optimization (80% of weddings Fri-Sun)
- Guest count impact estimation for load prediction
- Emergency scaling capabilities for unexpected load

## 📊 Performance Monitoring System

### Real-Time Metrics Collection
**File**: `/src/lib/broadcast/monitoring/metrics-collector.ts`

**Collected Metrics**:
- Queue performance (throughput, latency, error rate, queue size)
- Cache performance (hit rate, memory usage, evictions)  
- System metrics (CPU, memory, connections, response time)
- Wedding-specific metrics (active weddings, critical broadcasts, emergency alerts)

**Alert Rules** (8 configured):
- Queue error rate > 5% → Error alert
- Processing time > 1 second → Warning alert
- Queue size > 5,000 → Warning alert
- Cache hit rate < 80% → Warning alert
- Response time > 500ms → Error alert
- Active connections > 8,000 → Warning alert
- Emergency alerts > 0 → Critical alert

### Performance Dashboard
**File**: `/src/lib/broadcast/monitoring/performance-dashboard.ts`

**Real-Time Dashboards**:
- Performance metrics (latency, throughput, error rate, cache hit rate)
- Capacity monitoring (connections, queue size, scaling status, available capacity)
- Wedding-specific insights (active weddings, critical alerts, seasonal load)
- Health scoring (overall system health with component breakdown)
- Time series data with 48 data points for trend analysis
