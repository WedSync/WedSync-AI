## 🎯 MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

**Integration Mission**: Integrate couple onboarding with external wedding services, social platforms, and vendor discovery systems

**Real Couple Integration Scenario Delivered**: 
> "During Sarah and Tom's onboarding, they can now import their wedding inspiration from Pinterest boards, automatically sync their wedding date to Google Calendar, find their venue using Google Places integration, invite vendors they discovered on The Knot, and set up their Amazon registry - all without leaving the WedMe onboarding flow. The integrations feel seamless and reduce duplicate data entry across their wedding planning tools."
