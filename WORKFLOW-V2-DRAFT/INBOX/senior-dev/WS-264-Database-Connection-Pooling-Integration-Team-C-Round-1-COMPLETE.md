## üîß Technical Implementation Highlights

### Advanced Patterns Implemented

**Circuit Breaker Pattern**
```typescript
// Prevents cascade failures in external service integrations
private async executeWithCircuitBreaker<T>(
  operation: () => Promise<T>,
  serviceName: string
): Promise<T> {
  // Implementation with failure tracking and recovery
}
```

**Wedding Criticality Scoring**
```typescript
// 1-5 scale wedding impact assessment
export enum WeddingCriticalityScore {
  ROUTINE = 1,      // No weddings, normal operations
  ELEVATED = 2,     // Wedding tomorrow, increased monitoring  
  HIGH = 3,         // Wedding today, careful operations
  CRITICAL = 4,     // Wedding in progress, minimal changes
  EMERGENCY = 5     // Wedding disaster, all hands on deck
}
```

**Predictive Scaling Algorithm**
```typescript
// AI-powered load prediction based on wedding calendar
const loadPrediction = await this.predictDatabaseLoad(upcomingWeddings);
if (loadPrediction.confidenceScore > 0.8) {
  return this.generateScalingRecommendations(loadPrediction);
}
```
