5. **PII Protection**: Sensitive data masked in logs

## üìä Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Analytics calculated on-demand
2. **Caching**: Results cached for repeated queries
3. **Batch Processing**: Bulk operations for transactions
4. **Async Operations**: Non-blocking receipt scanning
5. **Pagination**: Large dataset handling

## üß™ Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests Required:
- Budget analytics calculations
- Receipt parsing accuracy
- Transaction categorization
- Reminder scheduling logic

### Integration Tests Required:
- Bank sync workflow
- Receipt upload flow
- Notification delivery
- Analytics generation

## üìù API Endpoints Needed

The following API endpoints should be created to support the features:

1. `POST /api/budget/receipts/scan` - Receipt upload and processing
2. `POST /api/budget/bank/connect` - Initialize bank connection
3. `POST /api/budget/bank/sync` - Sync bank transactions
4. `GET /api/budget/analytics/trends` - Get spending trends
5. `GET /api/budget/analytics/forecast` - Get budget forecast
6. `GET /api/budget/analytics/vendors` - Get vendor comparisons
7. `GET /api/budget/analytics/savings` - Get savings opportunities
8. `GET /api/budget/reminders` - Get payment reminders
9. `POST /api/budget/reminders` - Create payment reminder

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

1. **Environment Variables Required**:
   - `GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY` - For receipt scanning
   - `PLAID_CLIENT_ID` - For bank integration
   - `PLAID_SECRET` - For bank integration
   - `PLAID_ENVIRONMENT` - sandbox/development/production

2. **Database Migrations**:
   - Add `budget_transactions` table
   - Add `payment_reminders` table
   - Add `bank_accounts` table
   - Add `scanned_receipts` table

3. **Third-Party Services**:
   - Google Vision API account setup
   - Plaid account configuration
   - SMS provider setup (for reminders)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

1. **Lint Warnings**: Pre-existing ESLint warnings in the codebase (not from new code)
2. **TypeScript Errors**: Pre-existing type errors in other parts of the application
3. **Mock Data**: Bank sync uses mock data for demo purposes - needs Plaid integration

## üìã Next Steps

1. Create API endpoints listed above
2. Set up database migrations
3. Configure third-party services
4. Add comprehensive test coverage
5. Implement error handling and retry logic
6. Add user preferences for notifications
7. Create admin dashboard for monitoring
