## üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Database Layer
```sql
-- Core trial management with optimistic locking
CREATE TABLE public.trials (
    version integer DEFAULT 1, -- For concurrent updates
    health_score numeric(3,2) DEFAULT 100.00,
    extension_count integer DEFAULT 0,
    -- ... comprehensive trial tracking
);

-- Advanced analytics for wedding context
CREATE TABLE public.trial_analytics (
    weddings_created integer DEFAULT 0,
    team_collaborations integer DEFAULT 0,
    conversion_probability numeric(3,2),
    -- ... ML-ready data structure
);
```

### API Layer
```typescript
// Multi-operation endpoint with validation
export async function POST(request: NextRequest, { params }) {
  const validation = TrialOperationSchema.safeParse(body);
  const result = await TrialOperationsService[operation](params);
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true, data: result });
}
```

### React Integration
```typescript
const {
  trial, healthScore, eligibility,
  pauseTrial, resumeTrial, extendTrial,
  isTrialActive, canExtend, isAtRisk
} = useTrialManagement({ trialId, autoRefresh: true });
```

## üé™ WEDDING CONTEXT IMPLEMENTATION

### Venue Coordinator Support
- **40+ wedding project management** with team collaboration tracking
- **Client satisfaction metrics** integrated with trial health scoring  
- **Vendor network size** as conversion probability factor
- **Project completion rates** affecting extension eligibility
- **Team invitation tracking** for collaborative trial features

### Business Logic Enhancements
- **Activity scoring** considers wedding-specific actions (client management, vendor connections)
- **Engagement scoring** weighted for wedding industry workflows
- **Health penalties** for venue coordinators approaching wedding dates without activity
- **Extension eligibility** considers wedding project completion and team size

---

## üîí SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

### Row Level Security (RLS)
```sql
-- Organization-based access control
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their organization trials" ON public.trials
    FOR SELECT USING (organization_id IN (
        SELECT organization_id FROM public.user_profiles 
        WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    ));

-- Team member access inheritance
CREATE POLICY "Team members inherit trial access" ON public.trial_analytics
    FOR SELECT USING (organization_id IN (
        SELECT organization_id FROM public.user_profiles 
        WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    ));
```

### Audit Compliance
- **Complete audit trail** for all trial state changes
- **User attribution** for all operations
