## 🎓 KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER

### Key Architecture Patterns ✅
```typescript
// Wedding-aware component wrapper
const withWeddingContext = (Component) => (props) => {
  const weddingContext = useWeddingContext();
  return <Component {...props} weddingContext={weddingContext} />;
};

// Emergency escalation hook
const useEmergencyEscalation = () => {
  return useCallback(async (incident) => {
    if (isWeddingDay() && incident.severity === 'critical') {
      await triggerEmergencyProtocol(incident);
    }
  }, []);
};
```

### Critical Business Logic ✅
```typescript
// Wedding day detection (affects P0 escalation decisions)
const isWeddingDay = (): boolean => {
  const today = new Date();
  const dayOfWeek = today.getDay();
  return dayOfWeek === 0 || dayOfWeek === 6; // Sunday or Saturday
};

// Wedding-specific alert thresholds
const getAlertThresholds = (isWeddingDay: boolean) => ({
  responseTime: isWeddingDay ? 500 : 1000, // Stricter on wedding days
  errorRate: isWeddingDay ? 0.01 : 0.02,    // 1% vs 2% error tolerance
  uptimeMinimum: isWeddingDay ? 0.9999 : 0.999 // 99.99% vs 99.9%
});
```
