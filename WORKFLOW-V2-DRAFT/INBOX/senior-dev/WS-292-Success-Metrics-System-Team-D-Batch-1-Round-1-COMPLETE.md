## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY

### Mobile-First Design Principles
1. **Battery Optimization** - Adaptive tracking frequency (10s → 60s based on battery)
2. **Network Awareness** - Data compression, batch sizes adapt to connection quality
3. **Offline-First** - 50MB IndexedDB storage, intelligent sync with retry logic
4. **Privacy Compliance** - Anonymous fingerprinting, GDPR-compliant data collection
5. **Wedding Context Aware** - Enhanced performance monitoring for critical operations

### Key Technical Decisions
- **IndexedDB over localStorage** - Better storage limits and structured queries
- **Service Worker Integration** - Background processing without blocking UI
- **Compression Enabled** - Reduces mobile data usage by ~40%
- **Exponential Backoff** - Retry delays: 1s, 2s, 5s, 10s, 30s for failed syncs
- **Cross-Device Anonymization** - Hashed device fingerprints, no persistent tracking

### Wedding Industry Optimizations
- **Venue Connectivity** - Poor Wi-Fi/cellular handling with offline queue
- **Wedding Day Mode** - Stricter performance thresholds (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms)
- **Emergency Response** - High-priority event processing and immediate sync
- **Vendor Workflows** - Desktop → mobile → desktop journey tracking
- **Battery Safety** - Critical for all-day wedding coverage by photographers
