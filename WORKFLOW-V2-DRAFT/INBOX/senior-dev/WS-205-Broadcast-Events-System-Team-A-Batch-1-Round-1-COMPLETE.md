## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### System Design
The WS-205 Broadcast Events System implements a sophisticated priority-based notification system tailored for the wedding industry's unique requirements:

```typescript
// Core Priority Algorithm
export class BroadcastPriorityQueue {
  private readonly priorityWeights = {
    critical: 1000,  // Wedding cancellations, payment failures
    high: 100,       // Timeline changes within 48hrs
    normal: 10,      // Feature announcements
    low: 1           // Marketing messages
  };
  
  private calculateWeddingContextBoost(context: WeddingContext): number {
    if (!context) return 1;
    
    const daysUntil = context.daysUntilWedding;
    const isSaturday = new Date(context.weddingDate).getDay() === 6;
    
    // Saturday weddings get 3x priority boost
    const saturdayMultiplier = isSaturday ? 3 : 1;
    
    // Closer weddings get exponentially higher priority
    if (daysUntil <= 1) return 50 * saturdayMultiplier; // Wedding day/next day
    if (daysUntil <= 7) return 10 * saturdayMultiplier; // Within a week
    if (daysUntil <= 30) return 3 * saturdayMultiplier;  // Within a month
    
    return saturdayMultiplier;
  }
}
```

## 🎨 User Experience Design

### Wedding Industry UX Innovations
1. **Saturday Wedding Protocol**: Automatically filters non-critical messages on wedding days
2. **Wedding Context Cards**: Every notification shows couple name, venue, days until wedding  
3. **Priority Visual Language**: Color + Icon + Text (not color-dependent for accessibility)
4. **Role-Specific Workflows**: Photographers see different messages than coordinators
5. **Crisis Communication Mode**: Emergency wedding day messaging with large touch targets
6. **Offline Queue Management**: Messages queue when venue WiFi is poor
7. **Multi-Wedding Support**: Suppliers can manage notifications across multiple events
8. **Industry Terminology**: Uses wedding industry language (ceremony, reception, vendor)

### Mobile-First Wedding Context
- **60% Mobile Usage**: Designed primarily for mobile wedding professionals
- **Venue Environments**: Works in poor lighting, with gloves, outdoors
- **Battery Conscious**: Efficient animations, minimal background processing  
- **Touch Optimized**: 48x48px minimum touch targets, swipe gestures
