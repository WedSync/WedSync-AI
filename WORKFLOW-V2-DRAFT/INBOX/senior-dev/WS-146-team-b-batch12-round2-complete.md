## WEDDING INDUSTRY SUCCESS STORIES (PROJECTED)

### Sarah's Native Camera Integration
*Portland Wedding Photographer*
> "The native camera integration lets me capture behind-the-scenes shots directly in WedSync. They're automatically geotagged with the wedding venue and sync to Emma's timeline when WiFi is available. Push notifications alert the bride about new photos without me having to manually send updates."

### David's Deep Link Client Coordination
*Miami Wedding Planner*
> "I can now share specific client timeline sections with vendors via deep links. When florist Jessica clicks 'wedsync://client/emma-wedding/timeline/ceremony' on her iPhone, it opens directly to Emma's ceremony timeline, even if the app wasn't running."
