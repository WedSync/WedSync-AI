## 🔄 INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Initialize Mobile Analytics (React Components)
```typescript
import { initializeMobileAnalytics } from '@/lib/mobile/metrics/mobile-analytics';

// In your main App component
useEffect(() => {
  const mobileAnalytics = initializeMobileAnalytics();
  
  // Analytics automatically start tracking:
  // - Touch events, scroll behavior, device rotation
  // - Battery level, network quality, performance metrics
  // - PWA installation prompts and app usage
  return () => mobileAnalytics.stopTracking();
}, []);
```

### 2. Register Service Worker (App Initialization)
```typescript
import AnalyticsServiceWorker from '/analytics-sw-registration.js';

// Register analytics service worker
const analyticsSW = new AnalyticsServiceWorker();
await analyticsSW.register();

// Check status
const status = await analyticsSW.getStatus();
console.log('Analytics SW Status:', status);
```

### 3. Wedding Emergency Mode (Critical Workflows)
```typescript
// Enable emergency mode for wedding day operations
mobileAnalytics.enableWeddingDayMode({
  emergencyResponseThreshold: 50, // ms - stricter than normal
  prioritySync: true,
  highFrequencyTracking: true
});
```

### 4. API Endpoint Usage
