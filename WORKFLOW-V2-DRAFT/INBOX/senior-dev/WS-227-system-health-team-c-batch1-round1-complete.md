## 🏗️ Architecture Details

### Database Health Monitoring (`/lib/monitoring/database-health-advanced.ts`)
```typescript
class DatabaseHealthMonitor {
  // Singleton pattern for centralized monitoring
  // Comprehensive metrics: connections, queries, cache, storage, replication
  // Wedding-day mode: 10-second intervals vs 30-second normal
  // Real-time alert callbacks with deduplication
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Connection Pool Monitoring**: Tracks utilization, idle connections, connection leaks
- **Query Performance**: Average duration, slow query detection, QPS tracking
- **Cache Efficiency**: Hit ratios, memory usage, performance metrics
- **Storage Health**: Disk usage, growth rates, partition monitoring
- **Replication Status**: Lag detection, failover readiness checks

**Wedding Day Enhancements:**
- Enhanced monitoring intervals (10s vs 30s)
- Lower alert thresholds for early detection
- Priority alert routing and accelerated escalation

### Automated Recovery System (`/lib/monitoring/database-recovery.ts`)
```typescript
class DatabaseRecoverySystem {
  // 8 automated recovery actions
  // Wedding-day safety restrictions
  // Recovery plan generation with risk assessment
  // Success/failure tracking and rollback capabilities
}
```

**Recovery Actions Implemented:**
1. **Kill Idle Connections** - Reclaim connection pool resources
2. **Increase Connection Pool** - Dynamic scaling for high demand
3. **Clear Query Cache** - Reset cached query plans
4. **Restart Connection Pool** - Full pool refresh (non-wedding days only)
5. **Optimize Queries** - Automatic index suggestions
6. **Cleanup Temp Tables** - Reclaim storage space
7. **Vacuum Database** - Maintenance operations
8. **Emergency Failover** - Last resort failover to standby

**Safety Protocols:**
- Wedding-day restrictions on destructive actions
- Manual approval requirement for high-risk operations
- Rollback capabilities for all recovery actions
- Success rate tracking and learning algorithms

### Alert Management System (`/lib/alerts/alert-manager.ts`)
```typescript
class AlertManager {
  // Centralized alert lifecycle management
  // Deduplication within configurable time windows
  // Status tracking: active -> acknowledged -> resolved
  // Alert history and pattern analysis
}
```

**Alert Lifecycle:**
1. **Creation** - Alert generated with severity, metrics, and context
2. **Deduplication** - Prevents spam within 5-minute windows
3. **Acknowledgment** - Manual or automated acknowledgment
4. **Resolution** - Automatic or manual resolution with root cause
5. **History** - Long-term storage for pattern analysis

**Alert Types:**
- `database_connection_high` - Connection pool utilization > 80%
- `database_connection_critical` - Connection pool utilization > 95%
- `database_performance_slow` - Average query duration > 2000ms
- `database_performance_critical` - Average query duration > 5000ms
- `database_cache_low` - Cache hit ratio < 80%
- `database_storage_high` - Storage usage > 85%
- `database_replication_lag` - Replication lag > 1 second

### Multi-Channel Notifications (`/lib/alerts/notification-channels.ts`)
```typescript
class NotificationChannels {
  // Email, SMS, Slack, webhook, push notification support
  // Rate limiting and recipient management
  // Template-based messaging with dynamic content
  // Fallback channels for delivery failures
}
```

**Notification Channels:**
- **Email** (Resend API) - Detailed alerts with context and recovery suggestions
- **SMS** (Twilio) - Urgent alerts with concise messaging for mobile response
- **Slack** - Team channel notifications with formatted alerts and actions
- **Webhooks** - Integration with external monitoring systems (PagerDuty, OpsGenie)
- **Push Notifications** - Mobile app alerts for on-call personnel

**Rate Limiting:**
- 5 emails per minute per recipient
- 3 SMS per hour per recipient
- 10 Slack messages per minute per channel
- Exponential backoff for delivery failures

### Smart Escalation Engine (`/lib/alerts/escalation-engine.ts`)
```typescript
class EscalationEngine {
  // Role-based escalation paths
  // Wedding-day accelerated timing (4x faster)
  // Multiple escalation actions per level
  // Availability checking and fallback contacts
}
```

**Escalation Levels:**
1. **Level 1** (Immediate) - On-call engineer via email + SMS
2. **Level 2** (5 min / 1 min wedding) - Team lead + Slack channel
3. **Level 3** (15 min / 3 min wedding) - Engineering manager + voice call
4. **Level 4** (30 min / 5 min wedding) - CTO + emergency contacts

**Wedding Day Acceleration:**
- 4x faster escalation timing
- Immediate voice calls for critical alerts
- CEO/founder notification for system failures
- External vendor escalation (cloud provider support)

### Wedding Day Emergency Protocols (`/lib/alerts/wedding-day-protocol.ts`)
```typescript
class WeddingDayProtocol {
  // Saturday-specific enhanced monitoring
  // Business impact scoring with revenue calculations
  // Emergency contact management with availability checking
  // Automated recovery with enhanced safety checks
}
```

**Business Impact Scoring:**
- **Database Failure** - 95 points, £50k/hour revenue impact, 500+ affected weddings
- **Performance Issues** - 70 points, £15k/hour revenue impact, 200+ affected weddings
- **Connection Issues** - 60 points, £8k/hour revenue impact, 100+ affected weddings

**Emergency Contacts (3 Levels):**
