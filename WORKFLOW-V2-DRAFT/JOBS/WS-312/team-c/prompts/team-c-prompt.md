# WS-312 Team C - Enterprise SSO Integration System
## Database Schema & Infrastructure Security

### BUSINESS CONTEXT
Enterprise wedding venues require secure, auditable user identity management across their entire organization. When The Ritz London integrates WedSync with their Azure AD, they need bulletproof database security, comprehensive audit trails, and the ability to map 500+ staff members to appropriate wedding management roles. Database failures during wedding season are catastrophic for venue reputation.

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 with Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- **Migration Tools**: Supabase CLI for migration management
- **Indexing Strategy**: Optimized for enterprise user lookups and audit queries
- **Security**: Encryption at rest, connection pooling, backup strategies
- **Compliance**: GDPR, SOC2, and PCI DSS database requirements

### DELIVERABLES
**Core Database Schema:**
1. `/supabase/migrations/030_sso_providers.sql` - SSO provider configuration tables
2. `/supabase/migrations/031_sso_user_mappings.sql` - User identity mapping with enterprise directories
3. `/supabase/migrations/032_sso_audit_logs.sql` - Comprehensive audit trail tables
4. `/supabase/migrations/033_sso_sessions.sql` - SSO session management tables

**Security & Access Control:**
5. `/supabase/migrations/034_sso_rls_policies.sql` - Row Level Security for multi-tenant SSO
6. `/supabase/migrations/035_sso_indexes.sql` - Performance indexes for SSO lookups
7. `/supabase/functions/sso_user_provisioning.sql` - Database functions for user creation
8. `/supabase/functions/sso_audit_compliance.sql` - Compliance reporting functions

**Data Management:**
9. `/database/scripts/sso_data_migration.sql` - Migration scripts for existing users
10. `/database/scripts/sso_cleanup_procedures.sql` - Automated cleanup for expired sessions
11. `/database/backup/sso_backup_strategy.md` - Backup and recovery procedures

**Testing & Validation:**
12. `/database/tests/sso_schema_tests.sql` - Database schema validation tests
13. `/database/performance/sso_load_tests.sql` - Performance testing queries
14. `/database/compliance/sso_audit_queries.sql` - Compliance validation queries

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] Support 10,000+ enterprise users per organization with sub-50ms query times
