# WS-312 Team A - Enterprise SSO Integration System
## Frontend Authentication & User Experience

### BUSINESS CONTEXT
Enterprise wedding venues like The Ritz London need their 200+ staff members to access WedSync using their existing Azure AD credentials.

The SSO login experience must be seamless and wedding industry-appropriate.

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript, React 19 Server Components
- **Authentication**: Integrate @supabase/ssr with SAML 2.0 and OIDC providers
- **UI Components**: Untitled UI + Magic UI components with wedding industry branding
- **State Management**: Zustand for auth state, React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom wedding vendor color schemes
