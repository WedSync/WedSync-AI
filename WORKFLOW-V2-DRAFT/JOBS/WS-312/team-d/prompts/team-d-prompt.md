# WS-312 Team D - Enterprise SSO Integration System
## Integration Testing & Security Validation

### BUSINESS CONTEXT
Enterprise SSO failures during wedding season can lock out entire venue teams when they need urgent access to client details, dietary restrictions, or timeline changes. The Four Seasons wedding team cannot afford authentication delays when coordinating with photographers, florists, and caterers on wedding day. Comprehensive testing ensures bulletproof SSO reliability when it matters most.

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- **Testing Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library for frontend, Vitest for backend
- **Integration Testing**: Playwright for end-to-end SSO flows
- **Security Testing**: OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning
- **Load Testing**: Artillery.js for concurrent user simulation
- **Monitoring**: Grafana dashboards for SSO performance metrics

### DELIVERABLES
**Integration Testing Suite:**
1. `/tests/integration/sso/azure-ad-flow.test.ts` - Complete Azure AD authentication flow
2. `/tests/integration/sso/google-workspace-flow.test.ts` - Google SSO integration tests
3. `/tests/integration/sso/okta-integration.test.ts` - Okta SAML assertion testing
4. `/tests/integration/sso/multi-tenant-isolation.test.ts` - Venue data isolation validation

**Security Testing:**
5. `/tests/security/sso/saml-injection.test.ts` - SAML assertion injection attack tests
6. `/tests/security/sso/session-hijacking.test.ts` - Session security validation
7. `/tests/security/sso/oauth-redirect.test.ts` - OAuth redirect URI validation
8. `/tests/security/sso/compliance-audit.test.ts` - GDPR/SOC2 compliance checks

**Performance & Load Testing:**
9. `/tests/performance/sso/concurrent-logins.test.ts` - Load testing for 1000+ concurrent users
10. `/tests/performance/sso/wedding-day-simulation.test.ts` - Peak usage scenario simulation
11. `/tests/performance/sso/failover-recovery.test.ts` - SSO provider failover testing

**Monitoring & Alerting:**
12. `/monitoring/sso/dashboards/` - Grafana dashboards for SSO metrics
13. `/monitoring/sso/alerts/` - Alert configurations for SSO service health
14. `/scripts/sso-health-check.js` - Automated SSO provider health verification

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] 100% test coverage for all SSO authentication flows and edge cases
- [ ] Load testing validates 1000+ concurrent logins without performance degradation
- [ ] Security testing passes OWASP Top 10 vulnerability checks
- [ ] Integration tests run successfully against real Azure AD/Google test tenants
- [ ] Automated failover testing ensures <30 second recovery time
- [ ] Monitoring alerts trigger within 60 seconds of SSO service degradation

### WEDDING INDUSTRY CONSIDERATIONS
**Critical Wedding Day Scenarios:**
- Venue coordinator needs emergency access to dietary restrictions
- Catering manager requires immediate timeline updates during reception
- Security staff need instant access to guest lists for VIP arrivals
- Wedding planner coordinating with multiple vendors simultaneously

**Peak Load Scenarios:**
- Saturday morning: 200+ venue staff logging in simultaneously
- Mother's Day weekend: Highest wedding volume of the year
- New venue onboarding: Bulk import of 500+ staff members
- System maintenance: Planned failover during low-usage periods

**Compliance Testing:**
- GDPR Right to be Forgotten: Verify complete user data removal
- SOC2 Access Controls: Validate role-based permission enforcement
- PCI DSS: Ensure no payment data exposure through SSO vulnerabilities
- Wedding guest privacy: Confirm cross-venue data isolation

### INTEGRATION POINTS
**Team A Frontend Validation:**
- Test SSO login UI across all supported browsers and devices
- Validate error message display and user guidance flows
- Confirm accessibility compliance for venue staff with disabilities
- Mobile responsiveness testing on venue management tablets

**Team B API Integration:**
- Mock SSO providers for reliable testing environments
- API endpoint security and rate limiting validation
- Token refresh and session management testing
- Webhook delivery testing for user provisioning events

**Team C Database Integrity:**
- User provisioning data integrity checks
- Audit log completeness and retention validation
- RLS policy effectiveness testing across tenant boundaries
- Performance regression testing for database queries

**External System Integration:**
- Test integration with venue management systems (Opera, ALICE)
- Validate webhook notifications to existing enterprise tools
- Confirm SSO metadata exchange with enterprise IT departments
- Emergency access procedure testing for SSO provider outages
