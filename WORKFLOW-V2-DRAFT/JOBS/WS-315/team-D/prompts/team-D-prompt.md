# WS-315 Team D - AI Wedding Assistant & Chatbot
## Integration/Testing

### BUSINESS CONTEXT
Wedding AI assistants must integrate seamlessly with existing vendor workflows including CRM systems, calendar management, email marketing, and booking platforms.

- Jest/Vitest for comprehensive AI response testing and validation
- OpenAI API testing and conversation simulation frameworks
- Load testing for high-volume concurrent chat scenarios
- CRM integration testing (Tave, HoneyBook, Light Blue)
- Email system integration (Resend) for automated follow-ups
