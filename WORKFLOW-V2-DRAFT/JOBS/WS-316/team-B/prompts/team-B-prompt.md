# WS-316 Team B - Multi-Language Platform System
## Backend/API Development

### BUSINESS CONTEXT
Wedding platform internationalization requires sophisticated backend systems to manage translations, detect user languages, serve localized content efficiently, and integrate with professional translation services. The system must handle real-time translation requests, manage translation workflows, and ensure consistent terminology across all vendor communications and client interactions.

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Next.js 15.4.3 API routes with internationalization middleware
- Node.js 20+ with advanced string processing and encoding support
- TypeScript 5.9.2 with strict typing for translation keys and locales
- Supabase PostgreSQL 15 with full-text search in multiple languages
- Redis for translation caching and performance optimization
- Integration with professional translation APIs (Google Translate, DeepL)
- Content Management System for translation workflow management
- Language detection algorithms and user preference management
- Template engine for multilingual email and SMS generation
- RESTful APIs for translation management and content delivery
