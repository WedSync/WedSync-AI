# WS-317 Team C - Vendor Marketplace Integration System
## Database/Infrastructure

### BUSINESS CONTEXT
The vendor marketplace requires sophisticated database architecture to efficiently store vendor profiles, service listings, booking information, customer reviews, and complex relationships between vendors for collaboration packages. The system must handle high-volume searches, maintain data consistency across vendor relationships, and provide real-time availability tracking for thousands of wedding service providers.

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Supabase PostgreSQL 15 with advanced indexing for marketplace queries
- Full-text search optimization for vendor discovery and service matching
- JSONB columns for flexible service package and vendor profile data
- Geographic data types and spatial indexing for location-based searches
- Complex relationship modeling for multi-vendor collaborations
- Database partitioning for high-volume booking and review data
- Real-time subscriptions for availability and booking updates
- Row Level Security (RLS) for vendor data isolation and privacy
- Materialized views for marketplace analytics and reporting
- Automated data archiving for inactive vendor profiles and old bookings
