# WS-317 Team B - Vendor Marketplace Integration System
## Backend/API Development

### BUSINESS CONTEXT
The vendor marketplace requires robust backend systems to handle vendor registrations, service listings, booking management, payment processing, and multi-vendor collaboration.

- Redis for search caching and session management
- Elasticsearch or PostgreSQL full-text search for vendor discovery
