# WS-317 Team D - Vendor Marketplace Integration System
## Integration/Testing

### BUSINESS CONTEXT
The vendor marketplace must integrate seamlessly with external platforms, payment processors, calendar systems, and existing vendor management tools. Wedding vendors often use multiple systems (Tave for CRM, Google Calendar for scheduling, Stripe for payments), and the marketplace must synchronize data, handle bookings, and maintain consistency across all connected platforms.

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Integration testing with Playwright for end-to-end marketplace workflows
- Jest/Vitest for comprehensive marketplace functionality testing
- Stripe Connect integration for multi-vendor payment processing
- Calendar system integrations (Google Calendar, Outlook, CalDAV)
- CRM system integrations (Tave, HoneyBook, Light Blue)
- Map and location service integrations (Google Maps, Mapbox)
- Social media integrations for vendor profile enhancement
- Email and SMS integration for booking confirmations and updates
- Load testing for high-volume marketplace searches and bookings
- API testing for external vendor platform integrations
