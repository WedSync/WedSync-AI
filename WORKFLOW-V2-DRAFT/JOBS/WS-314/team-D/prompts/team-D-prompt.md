# WS-314 Team D - Advanced Automation Rules Engine
## Integration/Testing

### BUSINESS CONTEXT
Wedding automation rules must seamlessly integrate with external systems like CRM platforms, email services, and calendar applications. When a photographer's automation rule triggers, it might need to update their Tave CRM, send emails via Resend, schedule follow-ups in Google Calendar, and post updates to their Instagram account - all while maintaining data consistency and handling failures gracefully.

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Integration testing with Playwright for end-to-end automation flows
- Jest/Vitest for comprehensive unit and integration testing
- Webhook testing and simulation frameworks
- API mocking for external service dependencies
- Load testing for high-volume automation execution
- Integration with email providers (Resend, SendGrid)
- CRM system integrations (Tave, HoneyBook, Light Blue)
- Calendar integration (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Social media posting (Instagram, Facebook)
- Payment system integration (Stripe) for automation triggers
