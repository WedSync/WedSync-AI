# WS-314 Team C - Advanced Automation Rules Engine
## Database/Infrastructure

### BUSINESS CONTEXT
Wedding automation rules require sophisticated data architecture to handle complex rule definitions, execution histories, and performance analytics. A wedding photographer might have hundreds of automation rules with intricate conditions and dependencies that need to be stored efficiently and queried rapidly for real-time execution.

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Supabase PostgreSQL 15 with advanced indexing strategies
- JSONB columns for flexible rule definition storage
- Partitioning for high-volume execution logs
- Redis for rule execution queuing and caching
- Database triggers for automated rule activation
- Row Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenant automation
- Materialized views for analytics and reporting
- Database connection pooling and optimization
- Backup and disaster recovery for critical automation data
- Performance monitoring and query optimization

### DELIVERABLES
1. `supabase/migrations/030_automation_rules_schema.sql` - Core automation tables
2. `supabase/migrations/031_automation_execution_logs.sql` - Rule execution tracking
3. `supabase/migrations/032_automation_triggers_events.sql` - Event trigger system
4. `supabase/migrations/033_automation_rule_templates.sql` - Pre-built rule templates
5. `supabase/migrations/034_automation_performance_indexes.sql` - Database optimization
6. `supabase/migrations/035_automation_rls_policies.sql` - Security policies
7. `src/lib/database/automation-queries.ts` - Optimized database queries
8. `src/lib/database/automation-migrations.ts` - Schema migration helpers
9. `src/lib/cache/automation-redis.ts` - Redis caching for rule execution
10. `src/lib/database/automation-analytics.ts` - Performance analytics queries
11. `src/lib/database/automation-cleanup.ts` - Log retention and archiving
12. `src/lib/database/automation-backup.ts` - Backup and recovery procedures
13. `docker-compose.automation.yml` - Redis and database services
14. `src/scripts/automation-data-migration.ts` - Data migration utilities
15. `src/lib/monitoring/automation-metrics.ts` - Database performance monitoring
16. `src/__tests__/database/automation-schema.test.ts` - Database schema tests

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] Automation rules schema supports complex nested conditions and actions
- [ ] Execution logs partitioned by month with automatic archiving after 12 months
- [ ] Database queries execute in <50ms for rule retrieval and <100ms for execution logs
- [ ] Redis cache achieves >95% hit rate for frequently executed rules
- [ ] RLS policies ensure complete tenant isolation for automation data
- [ ] Database supports 10,000+ automation rules per tenant with optimal performance

### WEDDING INDUSTRY CONSIDERATIONS
- Store wedding-specific data points (guest count, venue details, service types)
- Handle seasonal data patterns with peak wedding season optimization
- Support wedding timeline milestones as automation trigger events
- Include vendor relationship data for multi-vendor automation coordination

### INTEGRATION POINTS
- Team A: Database queries for rule builder and execution preview
- Team B: Rule execution engine and webhook processing data storage
- Team D: Integration event logging and external system data synchronization
- Existing: User profiles, wedding data, payment systems, and form responses
