# WS-314 Team E - Advanced Automation Rules Engine
## Documentation/QA

### BUSINESS CONTEXT
Wedding vendors need comprehensive documentation and quality assurance for automation rules because these systems directly impact client satisfaction and business operations. A misconfigured automation rule could send wedding gallery links to the wrong couples or trigger payment reminders at inappropriate times, potentially damaging vendor relationships and reputation.

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

- User guides with screenshot walkthroughs for non-technical users
- QA testing protocols for automation rule validation
- Performance testing and monitoring documentation
- Security testing for automation rule access controls
- Integration testing procedures for external systems
- Error handling and troubleshooting guides
- Best practices documentation for wedding industry use cases
- Compliance documentation for data handling and privacy
- Training materials for vendor onboarding
