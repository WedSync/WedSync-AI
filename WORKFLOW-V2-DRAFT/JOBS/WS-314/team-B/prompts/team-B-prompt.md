# WS-314 Team B - Advanced Automation Rules Engine
## Backend/API Development

### BUSINESS CONTEXT
Wedding vendors need a robust automation engine that can reliably execute complex rules across thousands of client workflows. When a photographer uploads the final wedding gallery, the system should automatically trigger payment collection, send gallery access emails, schedule follow-up surveys, and update CRM systems - all while handling edge cases and failures gracefully.

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Next.js 15.4.3 API routes with proper error handling
- Node.js 20+ with async/await patterns
- TypeScript 5.9.2 with strict type checking
- Supabase PostgreSQL 15 with proper indexing
- Redis for rule execution queuing and caching
- Bull/BullMQ for job processing and scheduling
- Webhook system for external integrations
- Rate limiting and circuit breaker patterns
- Comprehensive logging with structured data
- Idempotent rule execution with replay capability

### DELIVERABLES
1. `src/app/api/automation/rules/route.ts` - CRUD operations for automation rules
2. `src/app/api/automation/execute/route.ts` - Manual rule execution endpoint
3. `src/app/api/automation/triggers/route.ts` - Event trigger registration system
4. `src/app/api/automation/webhooks/route.ts` - External webhook handling
5. `src/lib/automation/rule-engine.ts` - Core rule execution engine
6. `src/lib/automation/condition-evaluator.ts` - Rule condition evaluation logic
7. `src/lib/automation/action-executor.ts` - Action execution with error handling
8. `src/lib/automation/rule-scheduler.ts` - Time-based rule scheduling system
9. `src/lib/automation/execution-logger.ts` - Rule execution tracking and logging
10. `src/lib/automation/webhook-manager.ts` - External webhook management
11. `src/lib/automation/rule-validator.ts` - Server-side rule validation
12. `src/lib/automation/retry-handler.ts` - Failed execution retry logic
13. `src/lib/integrations/automation/email-actions.ts` - Email automation actions
14. `src/lib/integrations/automation/sms-actions.ts` - SMS automation actions
15. `src/lib/integrations/automation/crm-actions.ts` - CRM integration actions
16. `src/__tests__/api/automation/rule-engine.test.ts` - Comprehensive API tests

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] Rule engine processes 1000+ concurrent rule executions per minute
- [ ] Failed rule executions retry with exponential backoff (max 5 attempts)
- [ ] Webhook system handles 500+ external trigger events per minute
- [ ] Rule execution logs capture complete audit trail with timestamps
- [ ] API endpoints support bulk rule operations and batch processing
- [ ] System handles complex conditional logic with nested AND/OR operators

### WEDDING INDUSTRY CONSIDERATIONS
- Handle wedding date changes and their impact on existing automation rules
- Support multi-vendor rule coordination with cross-vendor data sharing
- Include wedding industry-specific variables (guest count, venue type, season)
- Manage peak wedding season load with 10x normal traffic handling

### INTEGRATION POINTS
- Team A: Rule builder UI and real-time execution feedback
- Team C: Automation database schema and execution history storage
- Team D: Email/SMS providers, CRM systems, and payment processors
- External: Stripe webhooks, calendar systems, and vendor management tools
