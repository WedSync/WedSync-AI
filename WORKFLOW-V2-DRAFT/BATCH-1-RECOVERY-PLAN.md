# CRITICAL: Batch 1 Round 3 Recovery Plan

## üö® PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

**Missing**: Round 3 prompts for batch 1 (WS-001 through WS-015)
**Status**: Teams completed Round 1 and Round 2 for batch 1, need Round 3 to finish
**Cause**: Dev Manager may have wiped team OUTBOX folders when creating batch 2

## üìä RECOVERY STATUS

### ‚úÖ CONFIRMED AVAILABLE:
- **Technical specs**: Archived in `/INBOX/dev-manager/archive/2025-01-21/`
  - WS-001 through WS-015 technical specifications exist
- **Team completion reports**: 
  - Teams C and E completed Round 2
  - Teams A, B, D are working on Round 2
- **Senior Dev review**: Round 1 review complete, Round 2 pending

### ‚ùå MISSING:
- **Round 3 prompts** for WS-001 through WS-015
- Located should be: `/OUTBOX/team-[a-e]/WS-XXX-batch1-round-3.md`

### ‚úÖ INTACT:
- **Batch 2 prompts**: WS-016 through WS-020 (Round 1 only so far)

## üîß RECOVERY OPTIONS

### OPTION 1: Manual Recreation (RECOMMENDED)
Use the archived technical specs to recreate Round 3 prompts:

```bash
# Technical specs available at:
/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/INBOX/dev-manager/archive/2025-01-21/WS-001-*.md
/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/INBOX/dev-manager/archive/2025-01-21/WS-002-*.md
...through...
/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/INBOX/dev-manager/archive/2025-01-21/WS-015-*.md
```

**Allocation needed for Round 3:**
- Team A: WS-001, WS-006, WS-011 (typically 3 features each)
- Team B: WS-002, WS-007, WS-012  
- Team C: WS-003, WS-008, WS-013
- Team D: WS-004, WS-009, WS-014
- Team E: WS-005, WS-010, WS-015

### OPTION 2: Re-run Dev Manager with Recovery Mode
Modify Dev Manager to recover missing Round 3 prompts without creating new batch.

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Step 1**: Recreate Round 3 prompts for batch 1
**Step 2**: Place in team OUTBOX folders with correct naming
**Step 3**: Verify teams can continue with Round 3 after completing Round 2

## üìã ROUND 3 FOCUS AREAS

Based on Dev Manager template, Round 3 should focus on:
- Full integration between all teams
- Complete E2E testing with Playwright
- Performance validation
- Documentation updates  
- Production readiness
- Final integration testing

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

‚úÖ All 15 WS features (001-015) have Round 3 prompts
‚úÖ Prompts follow naming: `WS-XXX-batch1-round-3.md`
‚úÖ Prompts placed in correct team OUTBOX folders
‚úÖ Teams can proceed to Round 3 after Round 2 completion
‚úÖ No disruption to batch 2 development (WS-016+)

## ‚è∞ URGENCY

**HIGH PRIORITY**: Teams completing Round 2 will be blocked without Round 3 prompts
**TIME SENSITIVE**: Teams C and E already completed Round 2 and need Round 3
