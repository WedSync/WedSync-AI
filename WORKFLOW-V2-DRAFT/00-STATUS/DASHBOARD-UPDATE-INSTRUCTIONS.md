# üìä DASHBOARD UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL DEVELOPMENT TEAMS

**üö® CRITICAL: Teams A, B, C, D, and E - You MUST update the project dashboard after completing ANY feature!**

---

## üìã WHEN TO UPDATE THE DASHBOARD

Update immediately when:
- ‚úÖ **Feature is completed** (moved from in-progress to done)
- ‚úÖ **Feature moves to testing phase** (ready for QA)
- ‚úÖ **Tests pass/fail** (update testing status)
- ‚úÖ **Feature becomes production-ready** (passes all checks)
- ‚úÖ **Feature is blocked** (dependency issues, blockers)
- ‚úÖ **Status changes** (any change in feature state)

## üìÅ FILES TO UPDATE (3 REQUIRED FILES)

### 1. Main Feature Status Tracker
**File**: `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/01-PROJECT-ORCHESTRATOR/feature-status.json`

**Find your feature** (search for WS-XXX) and update:
```json
{
  "id": "WS-XXX-your-feature-name",
  "status": "completed", // Options: "in-progress", "completed", "testing", "blocked"
  "completion": "100%", // Update percentage: "0%", "25%", "50%", "75%", "100%"
  "completed_date": "2025-01-25", // Add when status becomes "completed"
  "testing_status": "needs-testing", // Options: "needs-testing", "testing", "passed", "failed"
  "team": "Team A", // Your team: Team A, Team B, Team C, Team D, Team E
  "notes": "Feature completed in Round 1. All tests passing." // Brief update
}
```

### 2. Live Dashboard Data
**File**: `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/00-STATUS/data/live-status.json`

**When feature is completed**, add to the `"features"` array:
```json
{
  "feature_id": "WS-XXX",
  "name": "Your Feature Name",
  "status": "completed",
  "completion_date": "2025-01-25",
  "team": "Team A",
  "category": "core", // Options: "core", "ai", "mobile", "security", "billing", "marketplace", "testing"
  "testing_status": "needs-testing",
  "production_ready": false, // Set to true only when fully production ready
  "tech_stack": ["Next.js", "React", "Supabase", "PostgreSQL"], // Technologies used
  "description": "Brief description of what this feature does",
  "batch": "batch1", // Current batch you're working on
  "round": "round1", // Current round (1, 2, or 3)
  "evidence_files": [
    "/path/to/screenshot.png",
    "/path/to/test-results.json"
  ]
}
```

**Also update the summary statistics** at the top:
```json
{
  "completed_features": 145, // Increment by 1 when you complete a feature
  "overall_progress": 69.1, // Will be recalculated: (completed/total) * 100
  "last_updated": "2025-01-25T14:30:00Z" // Current timestamp
}
```

### 3. Completion Report (Evidence Package)
**Location**: `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/INBOX/senior-dev/`
**Filename**: `WS-XXX-[feature-name]-team-[A-E]-batch[N]-round[N]-complete.md`

**Template**:
```markdown

4. **Stakeholders see your progress** (real-time visibility)

## üéØ QUICK REFERENCE CHECKLIST

Before claiming any feature as "complete":

- [ ] `feature-status.json` updated with your WS-XXX feature
- [ ] `live-status.json` updated with feature details  
- [ ] Completion report created with evidence
- [ ] All files committed and pushed to Git
- [ ] Team identifier (A, B, C, D, E) is correct
- [ ] Testing status accurately reflects current state
- [ ] Production ready status is realistic
- [ ] Evidence package includes actual proof

## ‚ùì NEED HELP?

**File locations unclear?** 
- All paths are relative to `/Users/skyphotography/CODE/WedSync-2.0/WedSync2/`
- Look at existing entries in the JSON files for examples

**JSON syntax issues?**
- Use a JSON validator before committing
- Check for trailing commas and proper quotation marks

**Dashboard not updating?**
- Verify your JSON syntax is valid
- Make sure you pushed your Git changes
- Dashboard refreshes every 30 seconds automatically

**Categories/status unclear?**
- Look at existing completed features for examples
- Use the most specific category that fits your feature
- When in doubt, use "core" category

## üö® REMINDER FOR DEV MANAGER

**Add this instruction to ALL team prompts:**

```markdown
## üìä MANDATORY: UPDATE PROJECT DASHBOARD

After completing ANY work on your feature:

1. **Update feature-status.json** with your progress
2. **Update live-status.json** when feature is complete
3. **Create completion report** with evidence package
4. **Commit all changes** with dashboard update message

The dashboard provides real-time visibility to stakeholders and coordinates testing efforts. Updates are MANDATORY, not optional.

See `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/00-STATUS/DASHBOARD-UPDATE-INSTRUCTIONS.md` for complete instructions.
```

This ensures every team knows exactly how and when to update the project dashboard for maximum visibility and coordination!
