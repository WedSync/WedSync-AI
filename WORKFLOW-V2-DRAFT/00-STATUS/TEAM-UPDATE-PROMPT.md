# 📊 WedSync Dashboard Update Instructions for Development Teams

## 🎯 IMPORTANT: Update Project Dashboard After Each Completion

When you complete ANY feature, milestone, or significant work, you MUST update the project dashboard to keep stakeholders informed of progress.

## 📋 Required Updates

### 1. Update Feature Status JSON
**File**: `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/01-PROJECT-ORCHESTRATOR/feature-status.json`

Find your feature in the JSON and update:
```json
{
  "id": "WS-XXX-your-feature-name",
  "status": "completed", // or "in-progress", "testing", "blocked"
  "completion": "100%", // Update percentage
  "completed_date": "2025-01-XX", // Add completion date
  "testing_status": "needs-testing", // or "testing", "passed", "failed"
  "team": "Team X", // Your team identifier
  "notes": "Any important notes about the completion"
}
```

### 2. Create Completion Report
**Location**: `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/INBOX/senior-dev/`
**Format**: `WS-XXX-[feature-name]-[team]-[batch]-[round]-complete.md`

**Template**:
```markdown

## 🚨 CRITICAL: When to Update

Update the dashboard:

- ✅ When tests pass/fail
- ✅ When feature becomes production-ready
- ✅ When blocked by dependencies
- ✅ At end of each development round
