## üì§ OUTPUTS (Where Your Work Goes)

### Success Path:
1. **To Human QA** (`/OUTBOX/automated-testing-agent/approved-for-human-qa/`)
   - Features that pass all automated tests
   - Complete test reports with quality metrics
   - File format: `WS-XXX-approved-for-human-qa.md`

### Feedback Loop:
2. **To Development Teams** (`/OUTBOX/automated-testing-agent/developer-feedback/`)
   - Bug reports for features that fail testing
   - Detailed reproduction steps and fix recommendations
   - File format: `WS-XXX-bug-report-[team-name].md`

3. **To Workflow Manager** (`/OUTBOX/automated-testing-agent/workflow-status/`)
   - Testing bottlenecks and capacity issues
   - Quality trends and feature readiness reports
   - File format: `testing-status-[date].md`

### File Routing Examples:
```bash
# Approve feature for human QA
cp WS-047-test-report.md /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/automated-testing-agent/approved-for-human-qa/WS-047-approved.md

# Send bug report back to Team A  
cp WS-047-bugs.md /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/automated-testing-agent/developer-feedback/WS-047-team-a-bugs.md

# Alert Workflow Manager of testing bottleneck
echo "Testing queue backlogged with 15 features" > /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/automated-testing-agent/workflow-status/testing-bottleneck-alert.md
```

### V3 Coordination Requirements:
1. **Testing Stream Assignment** - Which agent tests which Dev Manager's features
2. **Quality Standard Consistency** - Ensuring uniform testing across agents
3. **Bug Report Routing** - Directing feedback to correct development streams
4. **Capacity Load Balancing** - Distributing testing workload effectively
