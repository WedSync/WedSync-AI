- Location: `/OUTBOX/senior-developer/WS-XXX-review-round1.md`
- Already sent to Dev Manager
- Found 80% hallucination rate and major issues

### üîÑ Round 2 Reports Ready for Review
Currently in your INBOX:
1. **Team C (WS-013)**: GDPR/CCPA Compliance Framework - Round 2 COMPLETE
2. **Team E (WS-006)**: Multi-Channel Notification Engine - Round 2 COMPLETE

### ‚è≥ Teams Still Working on Round 2
- Team A: Working on Round 2 (not yet complete)
- Team B: Working on Round 2 (not yet complete)  
- Team D: Working on Round 2 (not yet complete)

## Instructions for Round 2 Review

1. **Read the Round 2 completion reports:**
```bash
# Team C's Round 2 submission
cat /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/INBOX/senior-developer/WS-013-batch1-round-2-complete.md

# Team E's Round 2 submission  
cat /WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/INBOX/senior-developer/WS-006-batch1-round-2-complete.md
```

2. **Verify they addressed Round 1 issues:**
- Team C was approved with minor issues in Round 1 - check if they fixed lint warnings
- Team E had syntax errors in Round 1 - verify TypeScript now compiles

3. **Run verification commands:**
```bash
# For Team C (WS-013 - GDPR/CCPA Compliance)
ls -la /wedsync/src/lib/compliance/gdpr/
npm run typecheck
npm test compliance

# For Team E (WS-006 - Notification Engine)
ls -la /wedsync/src/lib/notifications/
npm run typecheck  
npm test notifications
```

4. **Create Round 2 Review:**
Save to: `/WORKFLOW-V2-DRAFT/OUTBOX/senior-developer/WS-XXX-review-round2.md`

## Round 2 Review Focus

Since Round 1 had massive hallucination problems, for Round 2 focus on:

1. **Reality Checks:**
   - Do the files actually exist this time?
   - Does the code compile without errors?
   - Do the tests actually pass?

2. **Did they fix Round 1 issues?**
   - Team C: Lint warnings fixed?
   - Team E: TypeScript/JSX syntax errors fixed?

3. **New Round 2 Features:**
   - Are the Round 2 enhancements properly implemented?
   - Do they build on Round 1 work correctly?

## Expected Outcome

Create a Round 2 review that:
1. Acknowledges improvements from Round 1
2. Verifies files actually exist now
3. Confirms TypeScript compiles
4. Validates tests pass
5. Approves or requests fixes for Round 2 work
6. Provides clear guidance for Round 3

## DO NOT:
- Review Round 1 again (already done)
- Wait for Teams A, B, D (review what's ready)
- Create another Round 1 review

## DO:
- Review Round 2 submissions from Teams C and E
- Verify they fixed Round 1 problems
- Check their Round 2 implementations
- Create WS-XXX-review-round2.md
