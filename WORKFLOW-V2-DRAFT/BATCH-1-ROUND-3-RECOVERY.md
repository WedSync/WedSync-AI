# BATCH 1 ROUND 3 RECOVERY - IMMEDIATE ACTION

## üö® CRITICAL SITUATION
Teams have completed Rounds 1 & 2 for batch 1 (WS-001 through WS-015) but Round 3 prompts are MISSING.

## üìä EVIDENCE OF TEAM ALLOCATIONS
Based on completion reports found:

**Team A:** WS-001 (Round 1 complete)
**Team B:** [No reports found - likely missing WS IDs]  
**Team C:** WS-003 (Round 1), WS-013 (Rounds 1 & 2 complete)
**Team D:** [No reports found - likely missing WS IDs]
**Team E:** WS-006 (Round 2), WS-008 (Round 1)

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE RECOVERY PLAN

Since exact allocations are unclear, I'll use a standard 3-per-team allocation:

### PROPOSED ALLOCATION:
- **Team A:** WS-001, WS-006, WS-011  
- **Team B:** WS-002, WS-007, WS-012
- **Team C:** WS-003, WS-008, WS-013  
- **Team D:** WS-004, WS-009, WS-014
- **Team E:** WS-005, WS-010, WS-015

## üîß RECOVERY STEPS

1. **Read technical specs** from archive
2. **Create Round 3 prompts** for each WS ID
3. **Place in team OUTBOX folders** with correct naming
4. **Focus on integration and finalization**

## üìã ROUND 3 TEMPLATE STRUCTURE

Each Round 3 prompt should include:
- Full integration with other teams' Round 2 outputs
- Complete E2E testing with Playwright
- Performance validation and optimization
- Production readiness checks
- Final documentation updates
- Integration testing between teams

## ‚è∞ URGENCY: HIGH

Teams are likely blocked or working on wrong features. This needs immediate resolution.

Would you like me to proceed with creating the missing Round 3 prompts using this allocation?
