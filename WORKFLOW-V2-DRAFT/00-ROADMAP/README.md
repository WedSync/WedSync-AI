# 🎯 THE ONLY GOAL: OCTOBER 1ST BETA LAUNCH

## 42 DAYS TO BETA - EVERY DAY COUNTS

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL FACTS

- **DEADLINE:** October 1st, 2024 (non-negotiable)
- **DAYS REMAINING:** 42
- **CURRENT COMPLETION:** 15-20%
- **REQUIRED COMPLETION:** 100% functional beta
- **DAILY MINIMUM:** 8 features (2% progress)

---

## 📊 WHAT BETA MEANS

**Beta = Ready for real wedding suppliers to test**

Not perfect. Not feature-complete. But FUNCTIONAL:
- Suppliers can sign up
- Suppliers can create profiles
- Suppliers can receive leads
- Couples can find suppliers
- Couples can book services
- Money can flow
- System doesn't crash
- Data is secure

---

## 📈 THE MATH

```
320 features remaining
÷ 42 days
= 7.6 features per day minimum

With 5 teams × 3 rounds:
= 15 development slots per day
= Achievable with buffer
```
