## 📋 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### FOR THE SIMPLE-DEV-MANAGER V3:

#### DAY 1 - START WITH THESE 5 FEATURES:
```bash
# Create these job folders immediately:
mkdir -p /OUTBOX/WS-001/  # Client List Views
mkdir -p /OUTBOX/WS-002/  # Client Profiles  
mkdir -p /OUTBOX/WS-007/  # Main Dashboard
mkdir -p /OUTBOX/WS-008/  # Navigation
mkdir -p /OUTBOX/WS-088/  # Authentication

# Generate 25 team prompts total (5 features × 5 teams)
# Each feature gets exactly: team-a.md, team-b.md, team-c.md, team-d.md, team-e.md
```

#### PROCESSING ORDER:
1. **Read** feature spec from INBOX
2. **Validate** it's legitimate WedSync feature (not sales/payments)
3. **Create** job folder `/OUTBOX/WS-XXX/`  
4. **Generate** 5 team prompts with clear focus areas
5. **Archive** processed spec from INBOX
6. **Move** to next feature

#### TEAM FOCUS ALLOCATION:
- **Team A:** Frontend components, UI/UX, React development
- **Team B:** Backend APIs, database operations, business logic
- **Team C:** Third-party integrations, external connections  
- **Team D:** WedMe mobile features, mobile optimization
- **Team E:** Testing, QA validation, performance monitoring
