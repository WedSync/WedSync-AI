# Forms System Implementation Summary

## Overview
The WedSync Forms System enables wedding vendors to create, manage, and collect information from couples through customizable digital forms. This replaces paper contracts, questionnaires, and intake forms with a modern, automated solution.

## Business Value for Wedding Vendors
- **Save 10+ hours/week**: No more manual data entry from paper forms
- **Reduce errors**: Automated validation prevents incomplete submissions
- **Impress couples**: Professional digital experience vs. PDF attachments
- **Stay organized**: All responses stored and searchable in one place
- **Get paid faster**: Integrated contract signing and payment collection

## Current Implementation Status: 45% Complete

### ✅ What's Working
- Beautiful drag-and-drop form builder interface
- 15+ field types (text, date, venue picker, timeline builder, etc.)
- Form preview with responsive design
- Template system for common wedding forms
- Database schema for form storage

### ❌ What's Missing
- Form responses not saving to database
- No client portal for couples to access forms
- Email notifications not configured
- PDF export functionality absent
- Payment collection not integrated
- Conditional logic not implemented
