## 📊 **CLASSIFICATION METHODOLOGY**

### **Phase 1: Data Integration & Analysis**
```typescript
// Load all previous agent results using Sequential Thinking MCP
await sequential_thinking_mcp.sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Loading comprehensive dataset from all previous agents: Platform Discovery (navigation gaps), Interactive Audit (broken UI elements), Component Discovery (available solutions). Need to analyze the complete picture to understand issue relationships and dependencies.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 8
});

// Integrate data from all sources
const discoveryData = await memory_mcp.retrieve("platform-discovery-results");
const auditData = await memory_mcp.retrieve("interactive-audit-results");  
const componentData = await memory_mcp.retrieve("component-mapping-results");

// Create unified issue database
const unifiedIssues = integrateAllIssueData(discoveryData, auditData, componentData);
```

### **Phase 2: Business Impact Analysis**
```typescript
await sequential_thinking_mcp.sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Analyzing business impact using wedding industry context. Critical features for wedding suppliers: client management (affects bookings), forms (affects lead capture), journey automation (affects client experience). Features affecting revenue generation get highest priority.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 8
});

// Wedding business impact scoring
function assessBusinessImpact(issue: Issue): BusinessImpact {
  const impactFactors = {
    affects_booking_process: 10,      // Highest - directly affects revenue
    affects_client_communication: 8,  // High - affects client retention
    affects_lead_generation: 8,       // High - affects business growth
    affects_workflow_efficiency: 6,   // Medium - affects productivity
    affects_branding: 4,              // Low-medium - affects perception
    affects_nice_to_have: 2           // Low - enhancement features
  };
  
  let score = 0;
  
  // Analyze issue context for business impact
  if (issue.page.includes('forms') || issue.page.includes('client')) {
    score += impactFactors.affects_booking_process;
  }
  
  if (issue.description.includes('navigation') || issue.type === 'broken_workflow') {
    score += impactFactors.affects_workflow_efficiency;
  }
  
  return {
    score: score,
    category: score >= 8 ? 'critical' : score >= 6 ? 'high' : score >= 4 ? 'medium' : 'low',
    reasoning: generateBusinessReasoning(issue, score)
  };
}
```

### **Phase 3: Technical Complexity Assessment**
```typescript
await sequential_thinking_mcp.sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Evaluating technical complexity based on Component Discovery results. Issues with available components = low complexity. Issues requiring backend work = medium complexity. Issues requiring new component development = high complexity. Also considering integration dependencies and state management requirements.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 8
});

function assessTechnicalComplexity(issue: Issue, componentMapping: ComponentMapping): TechnicalComplexity {
  let complexity = 0;
  const factors = [];
  
  // Component availability
  if (componentMapping.available_components.length === 0) {
    complexity += 5; // High - need to build components
    factors.push("No existing components found");
  } else if (componentMapping.confidence_score > 0.8) {
    complexity += 1; // Low - direct component match
    factors.push("High-confidence component match available");
  } else {
    complexity += 3; // Medium - component needs adaptation
    factors.push("Component available but requires adaptation");
  }
  
  // Backend integration requirements
  if (issue.type === 'api_error' || issue.description.includes('backend')) {
    complexity += 4;
    factors.push("Backend/API work required");
  }
  
  // State management complexity
  if (componentMapping.integration_approach.includes('state_management')) {
    complexity += 2;
    factors.push("Complex state management required");
  }
  
  return {
    score: complexity,
    level: complexity <= 3 ? 'low' : complexity <= 6 ? 'medium' : 'high',
    factors: factors,
    estimated_hours: estimateEffort(complexity, issue.type)
  };
}
```

### **Phase 4: Intelligent Categorization**
```typescript
await sequential_thinking_mcp.sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Creating intelligent issue categories based on fix approach: Quick Wins (high impact, low complexity), Infrastructure Fixes (backend/API issues), Component Integration (UI wiring), Complex Features (major functionality). This categorization helps developers tackle issues in logical groups.",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 8
});

// Issue categorization matrix
const categories = {
  quick_wins: {
    criteria: { business_impact: 'high', technical_complexity: 'low' },
    description: 'High-impact fixes with existing components ready',
    target_timeline: '1-2 days'
  },
  infrastructure_fixes: {
    criteria: { type: ['api_error', 'backend_issue'], impact: ['high', 'critical'] },
    description: 'Backend/API fixes essential for functionality',
    target_timeline: '3-5 days'
  },
  component_integration: {
    criteria: { type: 'non_functional_button', components_available: true },
    description: 'UI components exist but need wiring/integration',
    target_timeline: '1-3 days'
  },
  complex_features: {
    criteria: { business_impact: 'critical', technical_complexity: 'high' },
    description: 'Major features requiring significant development',
    target_timeline: '1-2 weeks'
  },
  enhancements: {
    criteria: { business_impact: ['low', 'medium'], technical_complexity: 'low' },
    description: 'Nice-to-have improvements for user experience',
    target_timeline: 'future sprint'
  }
};
```
