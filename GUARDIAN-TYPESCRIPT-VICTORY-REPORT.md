## 🎯 REMAINING STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

### **58,574 Remaining Errors - Next Phase Planning**
The remaining errors appear to be more complex issues requiring:
1. **Deep architectural analysis** for structural problems
2. **Type definition updates** for complex interfaces  
3. **Third-party library compatibility** fixes
4. **Advanced generic type resolution**

### **Recommended Next Steps**
1. **Phase 5**: Target remaining TS2xxx type errors (type checking issues)
2. **Phase 6**: Resolve import/module resolution errors (TS2307, etc.)
3. **Phase 7**: Fix generic type constraint issues
4. **Phase 8**: Address advanced TypeScript configuration needs
