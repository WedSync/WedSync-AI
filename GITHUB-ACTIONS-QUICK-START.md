- **Days 32-35**: Pre-launch human verification

## 🛠️ CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

### Modify Test Scope:
Edit `.github/workflows/intensive-testing.yml`:
```yaml
# Add new test types
matrix:
  test-type: ["auth", "payments", "timeline", "YOUR_FEATURE"]
  
# Adjust parallel jobs (reduce for budget)
max-parallel: 10  # Instead of 20
```

### Add Custom Alerts:
```yaml
# Add Slack notifications
- name: 🚨 Alert on failure
  if: failure()
  run: |
    curl -X POST ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }} \
      -d '{"text":"Test failure: ${{ matrix.test-type }}"}'
```

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues:
1. **Workflow not triggering**: Check you pushed to `main` branch
2. **Tests failing**: Verify WedSync app builds locally first
3. **Timeout errors**: Tests taking >30 minutes (check for infinite loops)
4. **Permission errors**: Ensure GitHub Actions enabled in repo settings

### Emergency Commands:
```bash
# Cancel all running workflows
gh run list --status in_progress | gh run cancel

# Check workflow status  
gh run list

# View specific run logs
gh run view [RUN_ID]
```
