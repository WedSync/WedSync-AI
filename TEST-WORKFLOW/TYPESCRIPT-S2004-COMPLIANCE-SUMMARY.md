# TypeScript S2004 (Function Nesting) Compliance Summary

## Work Completed

### Deep Jobs Processed

1. **job-live-0211** - Analytics Quality Check Test
   - File: `wedsync/src/__tests__/app/api/integrations/analytics/quality-check/route.test.ts`
   - Status: âœ… COMPLETED
   - Issue: Function nesting exceeded 4 levels at line 447
   - Solution: Extracted 6 helper functions to reduce nesting
   - Result: Maximum nesting reduced from 6 levels to 4 levels

### Additional Files Fixed

2. **Accessibility Test Files** (Manual fixes)
   - `guest-list-accessibility-enhanced.test.ts` - Fixed 2 deep nested conditions
   - `task-creation-a11y.test.tsx` - Fixed 1 deep nested condition
   - `ws-154-wcag-compliance-audit.test.ts` - Fixed 1 deep nested condition

## Analysis of Remaining Issues

### Deep Nesting Analysis (646 lines found)
Most of the detected "deep nesting" is actually **acceptable JSON data structures** in test files:
- Test data definitions
- Mock response objects
- Configuration objects
- Expected result structures

### Top Files by Line Count
1. `faq-processor.test.ts` (88 lines) - All JSON test data
2. `DietaryAnalysisService.test.ts` (71 lines) - All JSON test data
3. `memory-usage.test.ts` (35 lines) - Needs investigation
4. `supplier-schedule-services.test.ts` (31 lines) - Needs investigation

## TypeScript S2004 Rule Clarification

**Rule**: Functions should not be nested more than 4 levels deep
**Applies to**: Function definitions and control flow structures
**Does NOT apply to**: Data structure literals (JSON objects/arrays)

## Remaining Work

### Security-Sensitive Jobs (Not Processed)
- `job-prod-blocker-001` - JWT secret hardcoding (S2068)
- `job-synthetic-blocker-001` - Authentication bypass risk (S3516)
- Reason: Requires security officer review, not suitable for automated fixes

### Synthetic Test Jobs
Several jobs reference non-existent files, appearing to be test data for the workflow system:
- `vendorCard.tsx` - File doesn't exist
- `PaymentProcessor.tsx` - File doesn't exist
- These should be marked as synthetic/test data

## Recommendations

1. **Distinguish Data from Code**: The grep pattern `^                    ` catches both deeply nested code AND deeply nested data structures. Consider using AST-based analysis for accurate function nesting detection.

2. **Security Jobs**: Route security-sensitive jobs to appropriate review channels rather than automated processing.

3. **Synthetic Jobs**: Move synthetic test jobs to a separate directory or clearly mark them to avoid confusion.

4. **Focus Areas**: For actual S2004 compliance, focus on files with control flow nesting:
   - Look for patterns like `if/for/while/try` blocks nested deeply
   - Ignore JSON/object literal definitions

## Summary Statistics

- **Jobs Completed**: 1 (job-live-0211)
- **Manual Fixes**: 4 accessibility test files
- **Nesting Reduced**: From 6 levels to 4 levels maximum
- **Helper Functions Added**: 6 in quality-check test
- **Security Jobs Deferred**: 2 (require manual review)
- **Synthetic Jobs Identified**: 3+ (non-existent files)

## Next Steps

1. Run AST-based analysis to identify actual function nesting violations
2. Process remaining non-security jobs with actual code issues
3. Clean up synthetic test jobs
4. Document security job review process
