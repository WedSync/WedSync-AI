# 1. BIOME MCP TEST
Create a test file with formatting issues:
```
# Test command for Claude to run after restart:
mcp__biome__check_and_fix({
  file: "test-file.ts",
  fix: true,
  organize_imports: true
})
```

# 2. TYPESCRIPT CHECKED MCP TEST  
Test type checking on a TypeScript file:
```
# Test command for Claude to run after restart:
mcp__typescript_checked__verify({
  file: "wedsync/src/app/api/clients/route.ts", 
  check_mode: "strict",
  suggest_fixes: true
})
```

# 3. SEQUENTIAL THINKING MCP TEST
Test complex problem analysis:
```  
# Test command for Claude to run after restart:
mcp__sequential_thinking__sequential_thinking({
  thought: "Testing MCP integration for orchestrator workflow optimization",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 3
})
```

# 4. BROWSER MCP TEST
Test interactive browser capabilities:
```
# Test command for Claude to run after restart:
mcp__browser__navigate({ url: "http://localhost:3000" })
mcp__browser__take_screenshot({ filename: "test-screenshot.png" })
```

# 5. FULL INTEGRATION TEST
Test a real speed job with all MCPs:
```
1. Pick a real job from SPEED-JOBS/
2. Use Biome MCP to auto-fix
3. Use TypeScript Checked MCP to verify
4. Use Browser MCP to test UI (if applicable)
5. Measure time improvement
```
