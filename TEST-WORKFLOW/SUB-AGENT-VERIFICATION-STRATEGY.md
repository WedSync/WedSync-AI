# ü§ñ SUB-AGENT VERIFICATION STRATEGY
## Deploying Specialized Agents for Comprehensive Quality Assurance

**Created**: 2025-01-22  
**Purpose**: Use Task tool to deploy expert sub-agents for verification  
**Power**: Each agent brings specialized expertise to verification

## üìã SUB-AGENT DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Error Classification ‚Üí Agent Selection

```typescript
function selectVerificationAgents(error: Error): Agent[] {
  const agents = [];
  
  // Always deploy for context
  agents.push('pre-code-knowledge-gatherer');
  
  // Based on error severity
  if (error.severity === 'BLOCKER' || error.severity === 'CRITICAL') {
    agents.push('security-compliance-officer');
    agents.push('production-guardian');
    agents.push('test-automation-architect');
  }
  
  // Based on error type
  if (error.type.includes('async') || error.type.includes('performance')) {
    agents.push('performance-optimization-expert');
  }
  
  if (error.type.includes('auth') || error.type.includes('security')) {
    agents.push('security-compliance-officer');
  }
  
  if (error.affects.includes('UI') || error.affects.includes('UX')) {
    agents.push('user-impact-analyzer');
  }
  
  // Always verify specifications
  agents.push('specification-compliance-overseer');
  
  return agents;
}
```

### Step 2: Sequential Agent Deployment

```bash
# For each fix, deploy agents in sequence

# 1. BEFORE FIX - Knowledge Gathering
claude-code "Task: Deploy pre-code-knowledge-gatherer to understand the context of this async/await error in payment processing. Use Ref MCP to find similar patterns in our codebase."

# 2. AFTER FIX - Multi-Agent Verification
claude-code "Task: Deploy security-compliance-officer to verify this payment processing fix doesn't introduce vulnerabilities."

claude-code "Task: Deploy performance-optimization-expert to ensure this async fix doesn't degrade performance."

claude-code "Task: Deploy test-automation-architect to verify all tests still pass and create regression tests."

# 3. BEFORE COMMIT - Final Guardian Check
claude-code "Task: Deploy production-guardian to assess if this fix is safe for Saturday deployment."
```

## üîÑ PARALLEL SESSION AGENT ASSIGNMENT

### Optimize Agent Deployment Per Session

```yaml
session_1_blocker:
  dedicated_agents:
    - pre-code-knowledge-gatherer  # Every fix
    - security-compliance-officer   # Every fix
    - production-guardian           # Every fix
    - test-automation-architect     # Every fix
  reason: "BLOCKER issues need maximum verification"

session_2_critical:
  dedicated_agents:
    - pre-code-knowledge-gatherer  # Every fix
    - performance-optimization-expert  # Every fix
    - user-impact-analyzer         # Every fix
  reason: "CRITICAL issues often affect performance and UX"

session_3_major:
  dedicated_agents:
    - pre-code-knowledge-gatherer  # Every fix
    - specification-compliance-overseer  # Every fix
  reason: "MAJOR issues need spec compliance"

session_4_minor:
  dedicated_agents:
    - pre-code-knowledge-gatherer  # Sampling
  reason: "MINOR issues are lower risk"

session_5_info:
  dedicated_agents: []
  reason: "INFO level needs minimal verification"
```

## üìä AGENT VERIFICATION MATRIX

### What Each Agent Validates:

| Agent | Checks | Red Flags | Pass Criteria |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| pre-code-knowledge-gatherer | Context, dependencies, patterns | Missing context, unclear intent | Full understanding achieved |
| security-compliance-officer | Auth, sanitization, exposure | Exposed secrets, weak auth | No vulnerabilities found |
| performance-optimization-expert | Queries, bundle, runtime | N+1, large bundles, slow ops | <10% degradation |
| test-automation-architect | Coverage, regression, E2E | Dropping coverage, failing tests | 100% tests pass |
| user-impact-analyzer | UI, workflows, accessibility | Broken flows, poor UX | No regression detected |
| production-guardian | Deploy risk, rollback plan | High risk, no rollback | Safe with rollback ready |
| specification-compliance-overseer | Requirements, acceptance | Spec violations | Meets all criteria |

## üöÄ PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Fixing Async/Await in Payment Processing

```typescript
// Error: Missing await on payment processing
// File: src/app/api/payments/process.ts
// Severity: BLOCKER

// STEP 1: Deploy knowledge gatherer
await Task({
  description: "Understand payment context",
  prompt: `Analyze the payment processing flow in src/app/api/payments/process.ts.
           Use Ref MCP to find how we handle payments elsewhere.
           Identify all downstream dependencies.`,
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
});

// STEP 2: Apply fix
// ... fix the missing await ...

// STEP 3: Deploy verification agents
const verificationResults = await Promise.all([
  Task({
    description: "Security audit",
    prompt: "Verify this payment fix doesn't expose financial data or break PCI compliance",
    subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  }),
  Task({
    description: "Performance check",
    prompt: "Ensure adding await doesn't create blocking that slows checkout",
    subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  }),
  Task({
    description: "Test verification",
    prompt: "Run all payment-related tests and create regression test for this scenario",
    subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  }),
  Task({
    description: "Production safety",
    prompt: "Assess risk of deploying this payment fix on a Saturday with active weddings",
    subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  })
]);

// STEP 4: Only proceed if all agents approve
if (verificationResults.every(r => r.approved)) {
  commit("fix: Add missing await in payment processing");
} else {
  rollback("Verification failed - see agent reports");
}
```

### Example 2: Fixing Deprecated API

```typescript
// Error: Using deprecated Supabase auth API
// File: src/lib/auth.ts
// Severity: MAJOR

// Deploy specialized verification
await Task({
  description: "API migration check",
  prompt: `Verify migration from supabase.auth.user() to supabase.auth.getUser().
           Check all auth flows still work.
           Verify session management intact.
           Use Ref MCP to find all auth patterns in codebase.`,
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
});
```

## üìù AGENT REPORTS INTEGRATION

### Structured Agent Feedback

```typescript
interface AgentReport {
  agent: string;
  timestamp: string;
  verdict: 'APPROVED' | 'REJECTED' | 'WARNING';
  findings: Finding[];
  recommendations: string[];
  confidenceScore: number;
}

interface Finding {
  type: 'issue' | 'risk' | 'improvement';
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  description: string;
  evidence: string;
  suggestedFix?: string;
}

// Aggregate agent reports for decision
function makeVerificationDecision(reports: AgentReport[]): Decision {
  const criticalIssues = reports.filter(r => 
    r.verdict === 'REJECTED' || 
    r.findings.some(f => f.severity === 'critical')
  );
  
  if (criticalIssues.length > 0) {
    return {
      action: 'ROLLBACK',
      reason: 'Critical issues found by verification agents',
      details: criticalIssues
    };
  }
  
  const warnings = reports.filter(r => r.verdict === 'WARNING');
  if (warnings.length > 2) {
    return {
      action: 'REVIEW',
      reason: 'Multiple warnings require human review',
      details: warnings
    };
  }
  
  return {
    action: 'PROCEED',
    reason: 'All verification agents approved',
    confidence: calculateConfidence(reports)
  };
}
```

## üí° BEST PRACTICES

### Do's:
- ‚úÖ Deploy agents based on error severity and type
- ‚úÖ Run agents in parallel when possible
- ‚úÖ Trust agent recommendations - they're experts
- ‚úÖ Create regression tests from agent findings
- ‚úÖ Document agent decisions for audit trail

### Don'ts:
- ‚ùå Skip agents to save time
- ‚ùå Override agent rejections without review
- ‚ùå Deploy same agents for all error types
- ‚ùå Ignore agent warnings
- ‚ùå Proceed without production-guardian for BLOCKER fixes

## üö® CRITICAL INSIGHT

**The combination of Ref MCP + Sub-Agents creates an intelligent verification system that:**
1. Knows your exact codebase patterns (Ref MCP)
2. Applies expert judgment (Sub-Agents)
3. Catches issues humans would miss
4. Scales across parallel sessions
5. Gets smarter over time

**This is not just verification - it's intelligent quality assurance at scale!**

---

**Remember**: Every sub-agent deployed is like having an expert review your code. Use them liberally for critical fixes, sparingly for minor ones.
