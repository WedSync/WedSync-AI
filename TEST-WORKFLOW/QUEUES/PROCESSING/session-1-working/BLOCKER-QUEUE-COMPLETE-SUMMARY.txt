## PROCESSING RESULTS

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED ISSUES: 3/3 (100%)

1. **sonar-S128-002.json** - ‚úÖ FIXED & APPROVED
   - Issue: Missing break statement in switch default case  
   - File: wedsync/src/app/api/feature-requests/route.ts:264
   - Fix: Added `break;` statement to prevent fall-through
   - Status: Production Guardian APPROVED ‚úÖ
   - Impact: Code quality improved, TypeScript best practices enforced

2. **sonar-S3516-001.json** - ‚úÖ ALREADY RESOLVED
   - Issue: Function always returns same value (authentication bypass)

   - Status: Security vulnerability ALREADY ELIMINATED ‚úÖ
   - Verification: Production Guardian confirmed robust authentication in place
   - Impact: E-commerce security vulnerability prevention confirmed

3. **sonar-S128-001.json** - ‚úÖ FALSE POSITIVE IDENTIFIED
   - Issue: Switch cases fall through (stale SonarQube finding)
   - File: wedsync/src/app/api/feature-requests/route.ts:115
   - Status: FALSE POSITIVE - Never was broken ‚úÖ
   - Analysis: All switch statements verified as properly implemented
   - Impact: No action required, outdated analysis corrected
