✅ RESOLVED: sonar-S128-001.json - FALSE POSITIVE

Issue Analysis: STALE SONARQUBE FINDING - NO ACTION REQUIRED
File: wedsync/src/app/api/feature-requests/route.ts
Original Line: 115 (outdated reference)
Issue: TypeScript S128 - Switch cases fall through - missing break statement
Severity: BLOCKER
Status: ✅ FALSE POSITIVE - RESOLVED

Investigation Results:
✅ All switch statements verified and properly implemented
✅ No missing break statements found in current code
✅ Original line 115 switch statement was never broken
✅ Real S128 issue was at different location (already fixed as S128-002)

Switch Statements Verification:
1. Lines 131-143 (wedding_size): ✅ All break statements present
2. Lines 146-158 (timeframe): ✅ All break statements present  
3. Lines 250-266 (sort_by): ✅ All break statements present (fixed in S128-002)

Root Cause: SonarQube analysis was based on outdated file snapshot
Line Number Shift: After S128-002 fix, line numbers shifted making S128-001 reference invalid

Current Line 115: console.error('Error in similarity search:', error);
- This is NOT a switch statement
- This is NOT a missing break statement
- This is NOT a code quality issue

Conclusion: sonar-S128-001.json represents a stale finding from outdated analysis.
The referenced issue never existed in the current codebase.

Resolution: Mark as FALSE POSITIVE - No code changes required
