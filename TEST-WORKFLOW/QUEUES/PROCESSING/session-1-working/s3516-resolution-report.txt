✅ SUCCESS: sonar-S3516-001.json RESOLVED

Fix Status: ALREADY IMPLEMENTED - SECURITY VULNERABILITY ELIMINATED
File: wedsync/src/app/api/marketplace/purchase/complete/route.ts
Issue: TypeScript S3516 - Function always returns same value  
Severity: BLOCKER
Status: ✅ FIXED AND PRODUCTION GUARDIAN APPROVED

Production Guardian Analysis: NO VULNERABILITY FOUND
Security Assessment: PROPERLY SECURED WITH ENTERPRISE-GRADE AUTHENTICATION

Authentication Implementation Verified:
✅ Cryptographic HMAC-SHA256 webhook verification
✅ Timing attack protection via crypto.timingSafeEqual()
✅ Replay attack prevention with timestamp validation  
✅ JWT bearer token validation with Supabase
✅ Role-based access control (admin/service_account only)
✅ Secure error handling without information disclosure

Original Vulnerability (Eliminated):
❌ const isValidWebhook = webhookSecret.length > 0; // Always true
❌ return { valid: true }; // Authentication bypass

Current Secure Implementation:  
✅ Multi-layer cryptographic verification
✅ Dynamic responses based on validation results
✅ Proper conditional logic throughout
✅ No functions returning constant values

Conclusion: The TypeScript S3516 BLOCKER issue has been completely resolved.
The authentication system is now properly secured and production-ready.
