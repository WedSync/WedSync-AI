# Stale S2004 Violation Resolution Report

## Jobs Processed: job-live-0524, job-live-0525
**Date**: 2025-01-22
**Agent**: deep-agent-123126-8
**File**: wedsync/src/__tests__/ai/knowledge-base-system.test.ts

## Analysis
Both violations were identified as STALE - the original deep nesting code that triggered these SonarQube violations no longer exists at the specified line numbers:

- **job-live-0524** (line 292): Now contains simple forEach loop, not deeply nested
- **job-live-0525** (line 311): Now contains simple expect assertion, not deeply nested

## Root Cause
The violations were resolved by the comprehensive helper function extraction implemented in job-live-0523:
- Created `createBatchClassificationTestContent()` helper function
- Extracted complex object array definitions to reduce nesting from 5+ to 4 levels
- All violations in same nesting flow (Line 79 → 277 → 278 → 280) were simultaneously resolved

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - All S2004 violations in knowledge-base-system.test.ts eliminated by single helper function extraction
