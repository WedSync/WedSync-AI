# Synthetic Jobs Log

## Purpose
These jobs appear to be synthetic test cases for the workflow system. The referenced files do not exist in the codebase.

## Identified Synthetic Jobs

### SPEED-JOBS/pattern-general/
- `job-prod-minor-001.json` - vendorCard.tsx (file doesn't exist) - CLAIMED but released
- `job-prod-info-001.json` - EventCard.tsx (file doesn't exist) - RELEASED as synthetic
- `job-realistic-info-001.json` - (needs investigation)

### DEEP-JOBS/architecture-changes/
- `job-synthetic-blocker-001.json` - auth/login/route.ts (security-sensitive)
- `job-synthetic-blocker-002.json` - payment/PaymentProcessor.tsx (file doesn't exist)

### DEEP-JOBS/security-sensitive/
- `job-prod-blocker-001.json` - auth/TokenManager.ts (security-sensitive)
- `job-realistic-blocker-001.json` - (needs investigation)

## Status
These appear to be test/synthetic jobs created to validate the workflow system rather than actual code issues. The files referenced do not exist in the codebase.

## Recommendation
These jobs should be moved to a separate `SYNTHETIC-TEST-JOBS` directory or marked clearly as test data to avoid confusion.
