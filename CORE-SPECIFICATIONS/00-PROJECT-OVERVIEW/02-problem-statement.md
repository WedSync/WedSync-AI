## The Wedding Planning Crisis

### Industry Pain Points

### For Couples

1. **Repetitive Data Entry**
    - Average couple fills out 14+ similar forms
    - Wedding date entered 14 times
    - Venue details repeated endlessly
    - Guest count provided to every vendor
    - Dietary requirements scattered across suppliers
2. **Communication Chaos**
    - 200+ emails per wedding across vendors
    - Information lost in email threads
    - No central source of truth
    - Constant "what was that venue address again?"
    - WhatsApp groups, emails, calls - total fragmentation
3. **Coordination Nightmare**
    - 47 average timeline changes per wedding
    - Vendors don't talk to each other
    - Couple becomes reluctant project manager
    - No visibility into vendor progress
    - Last-minute surprises due to miscommunication
4. **Mental Load**
    - Tracking what each vendor needs
    - Remembering who has what information
    - Managing 14 different communication styles
    - Anxiety about missing something important

### For Suppliers (Using Photography as Example)

1. **Administrative Burden**
    - 10+ hours per wedding on admin tasks
    - Chasing clients for basic information
    - "What time is the ceremony?" asked 5 times
    - Manual data entry into multiple systems
    - Creating same documents repeatedly
2. **Information Gaps**
    - Never sure if venue details are final
    - Don't know other vendors until wedding day
    - Guest count changes without notification
    - Timeline updates missed in email chains
3. **Client Experience Issues**
    - Couples frustrated by repetitive requests
    - Look unprofessional asking for info they "should have"
    - Can't provide seamless experience
    - Reviews mention "disorganized" despite best efforts
4. **Missed Opportunities**
    - Can't automate due to fragmented data
    - Manual work prevents scaling
    - No time for actual creative work
    - Referrals lost due to admin friction

### Current "Solutions" That Don't Work

### Generic CRMs (HoneyBook, Dubsado)

- **Problem**: Not wedding-specific
- **Missing**: Core fields concept, vendor collaboration
- **Result**: Still siloed, still repetitive

### Wedding Planning Apps (The Knot, Zola)

- **Problem**: Focus on inspiration, not coordination
- **Missing**: Vendor-side tools, real collaboration
- **Result**: Pretty pictures, same chaos

### Project Management Tools (Trello, Asana)

- **Problem**: Too generic, high friction
- **Missing**: Wedding workflows, vendor integration
- **Result**: Another tool to manage

### WhatsApp/Email Groups

- **Problem**: Information scattered, no structure
- **Missing**: Automation, organization, history
- **Result**: Chaos with read receipts

### The Compounding Problem

Each wedding creates:

- **14 vendors** working in isolation
- **1,400 potential data entry points** (14 vendors × ~100 fields each)
- **200+ emails** that could be automated
- **47 timeline changes** manually communicated
- **10+ hours** of wasted time per vendor

This compounds to:

- **140+ hours** of collective wasted time per wedding
- **£5,000+** in labor costs for administrative tasks
- **30% higher prices** passed to couples
- **Stressed vendors** leading to poor reviews
- **Anxious couples** creating negative experiences

### Why This Problem Persists

1. **No Unified Platform**: Nobody has connected both sides
2. **High Switching Costs**: Vendors invested in current tools
3. **Network Effects Needed**: Requires critical mass
4. **Industry Resistance**: "We've always done it this way"
5. **Technical Complexity**: Needs wedding-specific features

### The Opportunity

The wedding industry is ripe for disruption because:

- **Digital Transformation**: COVID accelerated digital adoption
- **Younger Vendors**: Millennials/Gen Z entering industry
- **Couple Expectations**: Amazon-level coordination expected
- **Proven Pain**: Every vendor knows this problem intimately
- **No Dominant Player**: Market fragmented and open

2. **Industry Connections**: Trust and credibility built-in
3. **Technical + Domain Expertise**: Rare combination
4. **Timing**: Post-COVID digital acceptance
