# WedSync/WedMe Executive Summary

## Project Identity

- **Product Name**: WedSync (supplier platform) / WedMe.app (couple platform)
- **Category**: Wedding collaboration and coordination SaaS platform
- **Founded By**: James (wedding photographer with firsthand industry experience)
- **Core Innovation**: Dual-sided platform eliminating wedding planning fragmentation

## The Problem We're Solving

The wedding industry operates with catastrophic inefficiency. An average wedding involves 14 vendors, generates 200+ coordination emails, and requires couples to enter the same information (wedding date, venue, guest count) repeatedly for each supplier. Suppliers waste 10+ hours per wedding on administrative tasks, chasing information, and answering repetitive questions.

## Our Solution

WedSync/WedMe creates a unified collaboration ecosystem where:

- Couples enter their wedding information ONCE in WedMe
- This data automatically flows to ALL connected suppliers through WedSync
- Suppliers automate their entire client journey from booking to post-wedding
- Both sides get real-time visibility into planning progress

## Key Differentiators

1. **Core Fields System**: Revolutionary auto-population of wedding data across all vendors
2. **Built-in Virality**: Couples invite suppliers → Suppliers experience value → Suppliers invite more couples
3. **Wedding-Specific**: Not a generic CRM, but purpose-built for wedding workflows
4. **No Booking/Payment Processing**: Focuses purely on collaboration (avoiding complexity)
5. **Free for Couples**: Maximizes adoption through zero-friction entry
